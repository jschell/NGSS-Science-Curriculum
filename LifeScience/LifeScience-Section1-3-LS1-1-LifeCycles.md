## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Discovering Life Stages (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that all organisms go through stages from birth to death, but the stages look different for different organisms.

---

#### Part 1: Human Life Cycle Introduction (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Explore changes in human life cycle

**Student Does**:
- Look at photos of self (or family members) at different ages
- Put photos in order from youngest to oldest
- Describe changes: size, abilities, appearance

**Adult Asks**:
- "What's different about you as a baby versus now?"
  * Expected answers: Smaller, couldn't walk/talk, needed more help
- "What changes do you think will happen as you get older?"
  * Expected: Taller, stronger, more independent, eventually adult
- "Did you just appear as you are now, or did you grow slowly over time?"
  * Key idea: Gradual growth over time

**Introduce Vocabulary**:
- **Life Cycle**: All the stages a living thing goes through from birth to death
- **Birth**: When a living thing begins life
- **Growth**: Getting bigger and developing new abilities
- **Reproduction**: When a living thing can make offspring (babies)
- **Death**: When a living thing's life ends

**Student Records**:
```
Human Life Cycle Stages:
1. Birth (baby)
2. Growth (child, teenager)
3. Reproduction (adult, can have children)
4. Death (old age)
```

---

#### Part 2: Comparing Different Life Cycles - Video Exploration (25 minutes)

**Watch Videos Together**:

**Video 1: Butterfly Life Cycle** (5 minutes):
- **Resource**: Select butterfly metamorphosis video from PBS Nature Collection
- **Link**: https://thinktv.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/nat/t/growth-development-and-reproduction/
- **Watch for**: Egg → Caterpillar → Chrysalis → Butterfly

**Pause and Discuss**:
- "What stages did you see?"
  * Student lists: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly
- "How is this different from a human life cycle?"
  * Expected: Starts as egg, changes shape completely, has 4 distinct stages
- "What's the same as humans?"
  * Expected: Birth (from egg), growth, adult can reproduce, eventually dies

**Student Draws**: Quick sketch of butterfly stages in notebook

---

**Video 2: Frog Life Cycle** (5 minutes):
- **Resource**: Frog development video from PBS collection
- **What to Watch**: Egg → Tadpole → Tadpole with legs → Frog

**Pause and Discuss**:
- "How does a frog start life?"
  * Expected: As an egg in water
- "What's surprising about the tadpole stage?"
  * Expected: Looks like a fish, has tail, lives in water
- "How does it change into a frog?"
  * Expected: Grows legs, loses tail, can live on land

**Student Draws**: Quick sketch of frog stages

---

**Video 3: Mammal (choose one: dog, cat, elephant, etc.)** (5 minutes):
- **Resource**: Select mammal development video
- **Watch for**: Birth → Baby → Juvenile → Adult

**Pause and Discuss**:
- "How is this life cycle like a human?"
  * Expected: Baby looks like small version of adult, drinks milk, grows gradually
- "How is it like the butterfly or frog?"
  * Expected: Still has birth, growth, reproduction, death

---

**Compare All Three** (10 minutes):

**Activity**: Create comparison chart

**Student Fills Out** (with adult help):
```
| Organism  | Birth        | Growth Changes      | Reproduction | Special Features        |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Butterfly | Egg          | Caterpillar→Chrysalis| Butterfly    | Complete transformation |
| Frog      | Egg in water | Tadpole→frog        | Adult frog   | Lives in water then land|
| Dog       | Live birth   | Puppy→adult dog     | Adult dog    | Looks like adult from start|
```

**Adult Asks**:
- "What do ALL three life cycles have in common?"
  * Expected: Birth, growth, reproduction as adult, death
- "What's different about each one?"
  * Expected: How they're born, how much they change, number of stages

**Key Discovery**: All organisms have life cycles with the same basic stages, but the details are unique!

---

#### Part 3: Life Cycle Vocabulary and Patterns (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Define and identify the four common stages

**Adult Explains (Student Records)**:

**1. Birth - Beginning of Life**:
- Can happen different ways:
  * Live birth (humans, dogs, cats, horses)
  * Hatching from egg (birds, reptiles, insects, fish, frogs)
  * Seeds sprouting (plants)
- All organisms have a beginning

**2. Growth - Getting Bigger and Changing**:
- Some grow slowly and look similar the whole time (humans, mammals)
- Some completely transform (butterflies, frogs)
- Growth takes time and energy
- Need food, water, safe environment

**3. Reproduction - Making Offspring**:
- Only happens when organism is fully grown (adult)
- Makes new organisms of the same species
- Different methods: eggs, live birth, seeds
- Ensures species continues

**4. Death - End of Life**:
- All living things eventually die
- Can be from old age, disease, predators, accidents
- Part of the natural cycle
- Makes room for new organisms

**Pattern Recognition Activity** (10 minutes):

**Adult Gives Scenarios, Student Identifies Stage**:

1. "A robin sits on a nest keeping eggs warm" → Which stage?
   * Answer: Before birth (eggs) / Reproduction (parent)

2. "A kitten learns to hunt mice from its mother" → Which stage?
   * Answer: Growth (learning skills)

3. "An oak tree drops acorns on the ground" → Which stage?
   * Answer: Reproduction (making seeds)

4. "A caterpillar eats lots of leaves and gets bigger" → Which stage?
   * Answer: Growth

5. "A salmon lays thousands of eggs in a river" → Which stage?
   * Answer: Reproduction

**Student Creates** (15 minutes):
- Choose one organism (not yet studied)
- Research or imagine its life cycle
- Draw the four stages
- Label: Birth, Growth, Reproduction, Death

### Session 2: Life Cycle Models (75-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Create detailed models showing life cycles and compare multiple organisms to find patterns.

---

#### Part 1: Detailed Life Cycle Research (30 minutes)

**Activity**: Student becomes expert on 2 different organism life cycles

**Student Chooses 2 Organisms from Different Groups**:
- One insect (butterfly, bee, beetle, mosquito)
- One animal (frog, turtle, bird, fish, mammal)
- OR one animal and one plant

**Research Methods** (Adult Facilitates):
- Watch PBS videos for chosen organisms
- Read library books or websites
- Look at image searches for "life cycle of [organism]"

**For Each Organism, Student Records**:

```
Organism: ___________

Birth:
- How does it begin? (egg, live birth, seed?)
- Where? (water, land, nest, burrow?)
- What does it look like?
- Drawing: ___________

Growth:
- How many stages?
- What changes happen?
- How long does it take?
- What does it need (food, environment)?
- Drawing of each growth stage: ___________

Reproduction:
- When can it reproduce? (how old/large?)
- How? (eggs, live birth, seeds?)
- How many offspring?
- Drawing: ___________

Death:
- How long does it usually live?
- What might cause death?
```

**Adult's Role**:
- Help find appropriate videos or images
- Ask questions: "What do you notice about the baby stage?"
- Ensure student documents all four stages
- Take photos of student working

---

#### Part 2: Creating Life Cycle Circle Models (30-35 minutes)

**Activity**: Make circular diagram showing life cycle continues

**Materials**: Large paper, markers, ruler, compass or traced circle

**Student Creates** (for each of 2 organisms):

**Step 1: Draw Large Circle** (5 minutes)
- Trace plate or use compass
- Draw cross through middle (divides into 4 sections)

**Step 2: Label Sections** (5 minutes)
- Top: Birth
- Right: Growth
- Bottom: Reproduction
- Left: Death → connects back to Birth

**Step 3: Draw and Label Each Stage** (15 minutes)
- In each section: draw what organism looks like
- Add labels with key information
- Use arrows showing flow from one stage to next
- Make arrow from Death back to Birth (showing cycle continues with offspring)

**Step 4: Add Details** (5-10 minutes)
- How long each stage lasts
- What organism needs (food, habitat)
- Interesting facts

**Example - Butterfly Model**:
```
        BIRTH (EGG)
        [drawing of egg on leaf]
        "1-2 weeks"
             ↓
DEATH ←  CATERPILLAR (GROWTH)
[old butterfly]  [drawing of caterpillar eating]
"2-5 weeks"      "Eats leaves, grows"
     ↑                ↓
     ←  CHRYSALIS (GROWTH)
        [drawing of chrysalis]
        "1-2 weeks inside"
              ↓
        BUTTERFLY (REPRODUCTION)
        [drawing of adult butterfly]
        "Lays eggs, lives 2-4 weeks"
```

**Adult Asks** (for each model):
- "Why did you draw it as a circle instead of a line?"
  * Expected: Shows it's a cycle, repeats, offspring start the cycle again
- "Where in the cycle can the organism make babies?"
  * Expected: Reproduction stage, when adult
- "What would happen if one stage was skipped?"
  * Discussion: Cycle would break, organism couldn't complete life

---

#### Part 3: Comparison and Patterns (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Compare the two life cycle models to find what's the same and different

**Student Creates Venn Diagram**:

**Materials**: Paper, pencils

**Two Overlapping Circles**:
- Left circle: Organism 1 name
- Right circle: Organism 2 name
- Overlap: Both

**Student Sorts Information**:

**Different (unique to each)**:
- How they're born
- Number of stages
- How much they change
- How long they live
- Where they live

**Same (in both)**:
- Four main phases: birth, growth, reproduction, death
- Start small, grow larger
- Need food and water
- Reproduce as adults
- Cycle repeats with offspring

**Adult Asks**:
- "What was surprising about the differences?"
- "Why do you think ALL organisms have these four stages in common?"
  * Guide toward: This is what makes something "alive" - it has a life cycle

**Student Writes Summary** (5 minutes):
"All organisms have unique life cycles, but they all have in common ___, ___, ___, and ___. The life cycle is different for each organism because _____."

- [ ] **Written summary**: "All life cycles have in common..."
- [ ] **Vocabulary understanding**: Can define and identify birth, growth, reproduction, death
- [ ] **Optional**: Creative 3D model or presentation

---

## Evidence of Understanding

**Student can**:
✓ Explain that all organisms have life cycles
✓ Identify the four common stages: birth, growth, reproduction, death
✓ Describe how different organisms have unique life cycles
✓ Create models showing life cycles as continuous cycles
✓ Compare life cycles and find patterns
✓ Use evidence from observations and research to support explanations

---

## Extensions and Connections

**If Student Wants to Learn More**:

1. **Plant Life Cycles**: Research how plants grow from seeds (germination, seedling, adult plant, flowers, seeds)

2. **Life Cycle Length Comparison**: Research how long different organisms live (mayfly: 1 day, dog: 10-13 years, elephant: 60-70 years, giant tortoise: 100+ years)

3. **Incomplete Metamorphosis**: Compare complete metamorphosis (butterfly) to incomplete metamorphosis (grasshopper - egg, nymph, adult)

4. **Local Observations**: If season permits, observe life cycles in nature (tadpoles in pond, caterpillars, bird nests)

5. **Human Development**: Expand on human life cycle stages (infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age)

---

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't find information on my organism"**:
- Try different search terms: "[animal] life cycle", "[animal] babies", "[animal] development"
- Choose more common organism (butterfly, frog, chicken, dog are easy to research)
- Use PBS videos instead of reading

**"The life cycle seems too complicated"**:
- Simplify to just 3-4 main stages
- Focus on big changes, not every small detail
- Use more pictures, fewer words

**"All the life cycles seem the same to me"**:
- Look more closely at how they START (egg vs. live birth)
- Notice how much they CHANGE (does baby look like adult?)
- Compare how LONG each stage takes
- Look at WHERE they live during each stage

**"I don't understand what reproduction means"**:
- "Making babies" or "having offspring"
- Only adults can do this
- It's how the species continues (more of that organism)
- Many young might be born, but only some survive to adulthood

---

## Three-Dimensional Learning Integration

**Science and Engineering Practices**:
- **Developing and Using Models**: Creating life cycle circle models and diagrams
- **Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information**: Researching organisms, watching videos, presenting findings

**Disciplinary Core Ideas**:
- **LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms**: All organisms have life cycles with common stages but unique characteristics

**Crosscutting Concepts**:
- **Patterns**: All life cycles follow pattern of birth → growth → reproduction → death
- **Scale, Proportion, Quantity**: Different organisms have different life cycle lengths and numbers of offspring
- **Systems and System Models**: Life cycle as system with connected stages

---

**Time Investment Summary**:
- Session 1: 60-75 minutes
- Session 2: 75-90 minutes
- Session 3 (optional): 45-60 minutes
- **Total**: 3-4 hours
