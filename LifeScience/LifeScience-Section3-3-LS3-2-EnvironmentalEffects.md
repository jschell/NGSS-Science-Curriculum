## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Experimental Design and Setup (45-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Design and set up a controlled experiment to test whether environment affects plant traits.

---

#### Part 1: Introduction - Inherited vs. Environmental (15 minutes)

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Remember Section 2? What did we learn about inherited traits?"
  * Expected: Traits passed from parents to offspring
- "If all bean seeds come from bean plants, will they all grow the same?"
  * Expected: They're the same species, but might have variation
- "What if we give them different conditions - light vs. dark, lots of water vs. little water?"
  * Open-ended: Let student hypothesize

**Introduce Key Concept**:
- **Environmental Factors**: Conditions around an organism (light, water, temperature, food, space)
- **Can affect traits**: How organism develops and appears
- **Cannot change inherited traits**: A bean plant won't become a tomato plant
- **Can change expressed traits**: Size, color intensity, health, growth rate

**Examples to Discuss** (10 minutes):

**Human Examples**:
- Sunlight → skin gets darker (tan) - temporary environmental effect
- Exercise → muscles get stronger - environmental influence on body
- Food/nutrition → affects height and health
- All humans still look like humans (inherited), but environment affects how we develop

**Animal Examples**:
- Caterpillars in warm environment may develop different patterns
- Flamingos eat shrimp → pink color (food affects feather color!)
- Dog fur may be shinier with better nutrition
- Still the same species, but environment affects appearance

**Plant Examples**:
- Plants in sun grow tall and green
- Same plant in shade might be pale and spindly
- Hydrangea flowers change color based on soil pH
- Still the same plant species, but looks different

**Student Records**: "Environments can affect: growth, size, color, health - but not what species it is"

---

#### Part 2: Designing the Experiment (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Plan a fair test of environmental effects

**Question to Investigate**:
"How does the amount of sunlight affect bean plant growth?"

**Student Answers** (Adult guides):

**1. What will we TEST (independent variable)?**
   - Amount of sunlight: Full sun vs. Shade
   - Student writes: "We will test: sunlight amount"

**2. What will we MEASURE (dependent variable)?**
   - Plant height
   - Leaf color
   - Number of leaves
   - Overall health
   - Student writes: "We will measure: height, leaf color, leaf number, health"

**3. What will we KEEP THE SAME (controlled variables)?**
   - Same type of seeds (same parent plant)
   - Same amount of soil
   - Same size pots
   - Same amount of water
   - Same temperature (as much as possible)
   - Student writes: "Keep same: seed type, soil, water amount, pot size"

**4. How many plants in each group?**
   - At least 3 in sunlight
   - At least 3 in shade
   - More is better (reduces variation effects)
   - Student writes: "3-5 plants in each location"

**5. How long will we observe?**
   - Minimum 7 days after sprouting
   - Better: 14 days after sprouting
   - Student writes: "Observe for 10-14 days after sprouts appear"

**Create Hypothesis**:

**Student Writes Prediction**:
"If bean plants get more sunlight, then I predict they will ___
because ___."

Examples:
- "...grow taller because plants need light for energy"
- "...have darker green leaves because sunlight helps make chlorophyll"
- "...be healthier because light helps plants make food"

**Draw Experimental Design** (5 minutes):

**Simple Diagram**:
```
SUNLIGHT GROUP           SHADE GROUP
[3-5 pots drawing]      [3-5 pots drawing]
☀️ Sunny windowsill     🌑 Dark room/shade
Same water ↓            Same water ↓
```

#### Part 3: Setting Up the Experiment (20-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Plant seeds and establish conditions

**Step-by-Step Setup**:

**1. Prepare Pots** (5 minutes):
   - Label pots: "Sun-1", "Sun-2", "Sun-3", "Shade-1", "Shade-2", "Shade-3" etc.
   - Poke drainage holes if needed
   - Ensure all pots are same size

**2. Plant Seeds** (15 minutes):
   - Fill each pot with same amount of soil
   - Plant one seed per pot at same depth (1 inch)
   - Cover with soil
   - Water each pot with same amount (until soil is moist)
   - Student does this carefully, keeping conditions identical

**3. Place in Locations** (5 minutes):
   - Move sunlight group to bright sunny location
   - Move shade group to low-light location
   - Take photos of both setups
   - Record date and time of planting

**4. Create Observation Schedule**:

**Student Makes Calendar**:
```
Plant Care Schedule

Water: Every 2-3 days (same amount for all plants)
Observe: Every 2-3 days, record notes
Measure: Weekly (Day 7, Day 14, etc.)

Start date: _______
Expected sprout date: _______ (usually 5-7 days)
Final measurement date: _______
```

**Create Data Table** (5 minutes):

Average height: ____

Leaf Color Key: 1=very pale, 2=pale green, 3=medium green, 4=dark green, 5=very dark green
```

**Adult's Role**:
- Supervise to ensure fair test (all conditions same except light)
- Help student create consistent watering schedule
- Don't do the work - guide only
- Remind student this is ongoing investigation

### Session 2: Analysis and Conclusions (60-75 minutes)

**After 10-14 days of observations**

**Objective**: Analyze data to find evidence that environment affects traits, and construct explanation.

---

#### Part 1: Final Data Collection (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Take final measurements and observations

**Student Measures Each Plant**:
- Height from soil to tallest point
- Count total leaves
- Rate leaf color (1-5 scale)

- Shows clear comparison
- Label heights on bars

**Photo Comparison Board** (optional, 5 minutes):
- Print or display photos side-by-side
- Label "Sunlight Plants" and "Shade Plants"
- Visual evidence of differences

**Student Observes Graphs**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "What do the graphs show?"
  * Expected: Sunlight plants are taller/healthier
- "Is there a big difference or small difference?"
  * Student quantifies: "__ cm difference"
- "What about leaf color?"
  * Expected: Darker green in sunlight group

#### Part 3: Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Construct scientific explanation using evidence

**Framework**:

**CLAIM**: Answer to the investigation question
**EVIDENCE**: Data from experiment
**REASONING**: Why the evidence supports the claim

---

**Student Fills Out** (template provided or in notebook):

**1. CLAIM - What is your conclusion?**

"The amount of sunlight DOES / DOES NOT (circle one) affect bean plant growth."

"Specifically, plants in sunlight _____ compared to plants in shade."

Examples:
- "grew taller and had darker green leaves"
- "were healthier and had more leaves"

---

**2. EVIDENCE - What data supports your claim?**

**Student Lists Specific Data**:
- "Sunlight plants averaged ___ cm tall"
- "Shade plants averaged ___ cm tall"
- "Difference: ___ cm"
- "Sunlight plants had ___ color (scale), Shade plants had ___ color"
- "Photo evidence shows ___"

**Include at least 3 specific pieces of evidence with numbers**

---

**3. REASONING - Why does this evidence support your claim?**

**Student Explains the Connection**:

"This evidence shows that environment affects traits because:
- All seeds came from same parent plants (same inherited traits)
- All were given same soil, water, and care (controlled variables)
- The ONLY difference was amount of sunlight
- Therefore, the differences in height and color must be caused by the environmental difference (sunlight)
- This proves environment can affect how traits develop"

---

**Adult Asks Follow-Up Questions**:

1. **"Did the shade plants turn into a different kind of plant?"**
   - No - still bean plants
   - Environment didn't change WHAT they are (inherited species)
   - Changed HOW they grew (expressed traits)

2. **"If we moved a shade plant into sunlight now, what would happen?"**
   - It might start growing better
   - Shows environmental effects can sometimes change
   - Unlike inherited traits (those don't change)

3. **"Which traits were affected by environment?"**
   - Height (growth rate)
   - Leaf color (intensity)
   - Overall health/size
   - Number of leaves

4. **"Which traits were NOT affected by environment?"**
   - Still a bean plant (species)
   - Leaf shape (inherited)
   - Basic plant structure (inherited)

---

#### Part 4: Real-World Connections (10-15 minutes)

**Activity**: Apply learning to other examples

**Student Brainstorms Examples** (with adult):

**Where else does environment affect traits?**

**Humans**:
- Nutrition affects height and health
- Exercise affects muscle strength
- Sun exposure affects skin color (tan)
- Climate affects comfort (but not ability to live there)

**Animals**:
- Arctic fox: White fur in winter, brown in summer (temperature trigger)
- Butterflies: Wing patterns affected by temperature during development
- Birds: Feather quality affected by diet

**Plants**:
- Hydrangeas: Blue flowers in acidic soil, pink in alkaline soil
- Trees: Taller when not crowded, shorter when competing for light
- Leaves: Different sizes based on water availability

**Student Chooses One Example to Research** (10 minutes):

**Quick Investigation**:
- Find one real-world example
- Read about it (online or books)
- Create simple explanation:
  * What organism?
  * What environmental factor?
  * What trait is affected?
  * Does it change inherited species? (No!)

**Present to Adult** (3 minutes)

---

## Evidence of Understanding

**Student can**:
✓ Design a controlled experiment with identified variables
✓ Collect and organize quantitative data over time
✓ Calculate averages and create comparative graphs
✓ Use evidence to support scientific claims
✓ Explain that environment can affect how traits develop
✓ Distinguish between inherited traits and environmental effects
✓ Provide real-world examples of environmental influence on organisms

---

## Extensions and Connections

**If Student Wants to Learn More**:

1. **Multiple Variables**: Test water amount or temperature instead of light
2. **Recovery Experiment**: Move shade plants to sun, observe if they recover
3. **Extreme Conditions**: What if plant gets NO light vs. constant light?
4. **Human Examples**: Research how nutrition affects human growth
5. **Climate Adaptation**: How do organisms in different climates show environmental effects?

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Plants in both groups look the same"**:
- Wait longer (need at least 7 days after sprouting)
- Check if shade location is truly different (might still be too bright)
- Try more extreme conditions (full sun vs. closet/box)

**"All my shade plants died"**:
- Too dark - try brighter shade location next time
- Data still valid - shows extreme environment affects survival!
- Document what happened - still evidence of environmental effects

**"I forgot to water/observe regularly"**:
- Do best with available data
- Note gaps in observations
- Learn lesson about scientific consistency
- Can restart if needed

**"My results don't match my hypothesis"**:
- Great! Science is about finding truth, not proving predictions
- Analyze why results differed
- Still have data to support claims
- Discuss possible reasons (maybe shade location wasn't dark enough, etc.)
