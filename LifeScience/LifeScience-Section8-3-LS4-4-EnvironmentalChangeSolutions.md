## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Environmental Change Problems (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Identify environmental changes that affect organisms and analyze the problems they cause.

---

#### Part 1: How Environments Change (20 minutes)

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Can environments change over time?"
  * Yes - we learned this in Section 6 (fossils showed ancient environments were different)
- "What can cause environments to change?"
  * Student brainstorms

**Two Types of Environmental Change**:

**1. Natural Changes** (slower, organisms can sometimes adapt):
- Climate shifts over thousands of years
- Natural disasters (volcano, earthquake, flood)
- Seasonal changes
- Natural fire cycles
- Aging of ecosystems

**2. Human-Caused Changes** (faster, harder for organisms to adapt):
- Cutting down forests (deforestation)
- Building cities/roads (habitat loss)
- Pollution (air, water, land)
- Climate change (burning fossil fuels)
- Overhunting/overfishing
- Introducing invasive species

**Key Difference**:
- Natural changes: Usually slow, organisms have time to adapt or move
- Human changes: Often fast, organisms can't adapt quickly enough

**Focus**: This section addresses human-caused changes we can help solve

**Student Creates Chart**:
```
Environmental Change | Cause | Effect on Organisms
---------------------|-------|---------------------
Forest cut down      | Humans clear land | Animals lose homes, food
Ocean pollution      | Plastic waste | Sea animals eat plastic, get hurt
Wetlands drained     | Building development | Water birds lose nesting sites
Climate warming      | Greenhouse gases | Ice melts, polar animals lose habitat
```

---

#### Part 2: Case Study Research (30-35 minutes)

**Activity**: Investigate one environmental problem in depth

**Student Chooses One Problem** (or adult assigns):

**Option 1: Deforestation**
**Option 2: Ocean Plastic Pollution**
**Option 3: Wetland Loss**
**Option 4: Melting Arctic Ice**
**Option 5: Local Issue** (if applicable)

**Research Template**:

```

```

**Example - Ocean Plastic Pollution**:

**Problem**: Plastic waste ending up in oceans

**What's changing?**:
- Millions of tons of plastic enter ocean yearly
- Plastic doesn't decompose, breaks into small pieces
- Accumulates in ocean, beaches, and food chain

**Organisms affected**:
- Sea turtles: Eat plastic bags thinking they're jellyfish
- Seabirds: Feed plastic to chicks, can't digest, starve
- Fish: Eat microplastics, get stuck in plastic rings
- Whales: Swallow large plastic items, block digestive system
- Coral: Covered by plastic, can't get sunlight

**Impacts**:
- Animals die from eating plastic
- Get tangled in plastic (fishing nets, six-pack rings)
- Habitat polluted, unhealthy environment
- Population numbers decreasing

**Evidence**:
- Ocean Conservancy statistics
- Photos of affected animals
- Scientific studies showing plastic in fish stomachs

**Student Documents** (20 minutes):

#### Part 3: Problem Impact Analysis (10-15 minutes)

**Activity**: Understand full scope of problem

**Student Answers**:

**Short-term effects** (now):
- What's happening to organisms right now?
- Are any dying or struggling?

**Long-term effects** (future):
- If problem continues, what will happen?
- Could species go extinct?
- How will ecosystem change?

**Urgency level**:
- How quickly must we act?
- Is this an emergency or slower problem?

**Student Creates Impact Statement**:

"The problem of [environmental change] is affecting [organisms] by [specific impacts]. If we don't act, [future consequences]. This is [urgent/moderate/slow] priority because [reasoning]."

Example:
"The problem of ocean plastic pollution is affecting sea turtles, seabirds, and fish by causing them to eat plastic and die. If we don't act, these populations will continue to decline and some species could become extinct. This is urgent priority because millions of animals are already dying and the problem is getting worse."
