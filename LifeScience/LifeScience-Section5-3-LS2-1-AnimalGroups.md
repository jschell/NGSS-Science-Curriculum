## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Evidence Collection - Group Benefits (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Research and document evidence of how animal groups help members survive.

---

#### Part 1: Solo vs. Group Comparison (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Think about advantages and disadvantages of being alone vs. in a group

**Human Example First**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Imagine you're alone in a big building. What's hard about being alone?"
  * No one to help, scary, lonely, have to do everything yourself
- "Now imagine you're with friends. What's easier?"
  * Can help each other, protect each other, more fun, share work
- "Do you think animals have similar benefits from groups?"

**Create Comparison Chart**:

**Student Fills Out**:
```
LIVING ALONE vs. LIVING IN A GROUP

Advantages of Being Alone:
- Don't have to share food
- Can go wherever you want
- Quiet
- ___________

Disadvantages of Being Alone:
- Have to find all food yourself
- No help if sick or hurt
- Have to watch for predators alone
- ___________

Advantages of Being in a Group:
- Help finding food
- Protection from predators
- Can share tasks
- ___________

Disadvantages of Being in a Group:
- Have to share food
- Might have conflicts
- Can attract attention
- ___________
```

**Key Question**: "For animals, which benefits are most important for SURVIVAL?"
- Protection from predators
- Finding food

- One herd animal (elephants, zebras, buffalo)
- One colony/swarm (ants, bees, penguins)
- One flock/school (birds, fish)

**For Each Animal, Research and Record**:

**Template** (use Section5_Animal_Groups_Research.pdf or notebook):

```
Animal: ___________

Type of Group: (pack/herd/colony/flock)

  * Pups protected while parents hunt
- Evidence: [Nature documentary]

**Example 3: Emperor Penguins**:
- Type: Colony
- Size: Hundreds to thousands
- Activities: Huddle together, take turns in center
- Benefits:
  * Share body heat in Antarctic cold
  * Protect eggs/chicks from freezing

  * Survival in extreme environment
- Evidence: [PBS Nature, books]

**Example 4: Schooling Fish**:
- Type: School
- Size: Dozens to thousands
- Activities: Swim in coordinated group
- Benefits:
  * Confuse predators (hard to target one fish)
  * More eyes to spot danger
  * More efficient swimming (draft effect)
  * Better at finding food
- Evidence: [Ocean videos, science articles]

**Research Time** (30 minutes):

#### Part 3: Identifying Patterns (10-15 minutes)

**Activity**: Find common themes across different animal groups

**Student Reviews All Research**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "What benefits showed up for MORE THAN ONE animal group?"
  * Student lists: protection, food, raising young, etc.
- "Which benefit seems most common?"
  * Usually protection from predators
- "Did any groups have unique benefits?"
  * Example: penguins sharing warmth

**Create Summary Chart**:

```
COMMON GROUP BENEFITS

Benefit | How Many Animals? | Examples
--------|-------------------|----------
Protection from predators | ___ | ___
Help finding/catching food | ___ | ___
Raising young together | ___ | ___
Sharing warmth/shelter | ___ | ___
Warning of danger | ___ | ___
Other: ___ | ___ | ___
```

**Student Concludes**:
"The most common reason animals form groups is ___ because ___."

---

### Session 2: Constructing and Presenting Argument (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Build evidence-based argument that animal groups help survival, and present it.

---

#### Part 1: Argument Construction (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Write formal scientific argument with evidence

**Framework**: Claim → Evidence → Reasoning

**Student Writes**:

**CLAIM**: Main argument statement

"Some animals form groups that help members survive."

OR more specific:
"[Specific animal] forms groups that help members survive by providing protection, helping with food, and supporting offspring."

**EVIDENCE**: Specific examples from research

"Evidence supporting this claim includes:

1. **Wolves** hunt in packs to take down large prey like elk and moose. A single wolf cannot successfully hunt these animals, but a pack working together can. This provides more food for pack members. (Source: PBS Nature video)

2. **Meerkats** take turns acting as lookouts while others hunt for food. The lookout stands on high ground and makes warning calls if predators like eagles or snakes approach. This allows the group to escape danger. (Source: Meerkat documentary)

3. **Emperor penguins** huddle together in groups of hundreds during Antarctic winter. They take turns being in the protected center of the huddle versus the cold outer edge. This sharing keeps them warm enough to survive and protect their eggs. (Source: March of the Penguins)

4. **Fish** swim in schools which confuses predators. When a shark attacks, it's hard to focus on one fish among hundreds swimming in coordinated patterns. This reduces each individual fish's chance of being eaten. (Source: Ocean Life Encyclopedia)"

**REASONING**: Connect evidence to claim

"This evidence supports the claim that animal groups help survival because:

- Each example shows a specific survival challenge (predators, hunting, cold, or finding food)
- In each case, the group behavior directly addresses the challenge
- Individual animals would struggle or die without the group
- Group members have better chance of surviving to adulthood
- Animals that survive can reproduce and pass on group behavior
- Therefore, forming groups is a survival advantage"

**Student Writes Complete Argument** (15-20 minutes):
- Use template or write in notebook
- Include all sections
- Adult helps with organization if needed

---

#### Part 2: Counter-Argument Consideration (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Address potential objections to strengthen argument

**Adult Asks**:
"Could someone argue that living in groups is BAD for survival?"

**Student Considers**:

**Possible Counter-Arguments**:
- "Groups have to share food, so individuals get less"
- "Groups attract predators because they're more visible"
- "Animals in groups might compete and fight"
- "Diseases spread more easily in groups"

**Student Responds to Each**:

Example response:
"While it's true that group members must share food, the benefits outweigh this cost because:
- Groups can catch BIGGER prey (more total food)
- Groups can find food faster (more eyes searching)
- Even with sharing, each member gets enough to survive
- Evidence: Wolf packs successfully feed all members by hunting large elk"

**This Teaches**: Strong arguments consider and address counter-arguments with evidence

**Student Adds to Argument** (optional):
"Some might argue that living in groups has disadvantages like sharing food or spreading disease. However, the survival benefits outweigh these costs because [specific evidence]."

---

#### Part 3: Visual Argument Creation (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Create visual presentation of argument

- Slide 6: Conclusion and reasoning

**Option 3: Flip Book**:
- Page 1: Claim
- Pages 2-5: Animal examples
- Page 6: Conclusion

**Option 4: Comic Strip**:
- Show animal alone (struggles)
- Then same animal in group (succeeds)
- For 3-4 different animals

**Required Elements** (any format):
- Clear claim statement
- At least 3 animal examples
- Specific benefits explained

---

#### Part 4: Presentation and Discussion (10-15 minutes)

**Activity**: Present argument to family member

**Student Presents**:
- Shows visual argument
- States claim clearly
- Explains each piece of evidence
- Answers questions

**Family Member Asks** (adult coaches if presenting to self):
- "Why did you choose these animals?"
- "What surprised you in your research?"
- "Which group benefit seems most important?"
- "Can you think of other animals that live in groups?"
- "Do humans benefit from living in groups too?"

**Reflection** (5 minutes):

**Student Writes**:
"After researching animal groups, I learned that ___. The most interesting thing was ___. This connects to what we learned about variation and survival because ___."

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't find enough information"**:
- Use suggested animals (wolves, meerkats, penguins, fish)
- Watch PBS Nature videos - very informative
- Library has many animal group books for kids
- Adult can help search age-appropriate sources

**"All the benefits seem the same"**:
- Look more closely at specific details
- How EXACTLY does each group protect members?
- What SPECIFIC foods do they catch together?
- Details make the evidence stronger

**"My argument feels short"**:
- Add more examples (4-5 animals instead of 3)
- Include more details for each example
- Add measurements/numbers if available
- Describe specific behaviors observed

**"I don't understand counter-arguments"**:
- Think: "What could go wrong in a group?"
- Then respond: "Yes, but the benefits are bigger because..."
- Not required for completion, but strengthens thinking
