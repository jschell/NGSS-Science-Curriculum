## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Observing Variation and Advantages (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Observe variation within species and identify how different traits could provide advantages in different situations.

---

#### Part 1: Introduction - Variation Review (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Examine variation in familiar objects

**If Available: Different Apple Varieties** (or other fruit):

**Student Observes**:
- 3-4 different types of apples (Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Gala, etc.)
- All are apples (same species)
- But look different: color, size, sweetness, texture

**Create Comparison**:
```
Apple Variety | Color | Size | Sweetness | Texture
--------------|-------|------|-----------|--------
Type 1        |       |      |           |
Type 2        |       |      |           |
Type 3        |       |      |           |
```

**Adult Asks**:
- "Are these all apples?"
  * Yes - same species
- "Are they identical?"
  * No - variation exists
- "Do people prefer different types?"
  * Yes - some like sweet, some like tart
- "Could this be true for animals too?"
  * Yes!

**Alternative if No Physical Examples**:
- Look at photos of different dog breeds online
- Or different colored butterflies
- Or different bird beak shapes

**Key Concept**: Variation exists in all species. Different variations can be useful in different situations.

---

#### Part 2: Case Study - Bird Beaks (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Understand how beak variation helps different birds

**Research Activity**:

**Student Investigates** (with adult help, using online images or books):

**Find 4 Different Bird Beaks**:
1. **Long, thin beak** (hummingbird)
2. **Short, strong beak** (cardinal, finch)
3. **Hooked beak** (hawk, eagle)
4. **Flat, wide beak** (duck)

**For Each Bird, Record**:
```
Bird: _________

Beak Shape: _________
What does it eat? _________
How does beak help? _________
Drawing of beak: _________
```

**Examples to Discover**:

**Hummingbird**:
- Beak: Long and thin
- Food: Nectar from flowers
- Advantage: Can reach deep into flowers
- Would this work for eating seeds? No!

**Cardinal**:
- Beak: Short and strong
- Food: Seeds, nuts
- Advantage: Can crack hard shells
- Would this work for nectar? No!

**Hawk**:
- Beak: Hooked and sharp
- Food: Meat (small animals)
- Advantage: Can tear meat
- Would this work for seeds? No!

**Duck**:
- Beak: Flat and wide
- Food: Water plants, small fish
- Advantage: Can scoop and filter water
- Would this work for cracking nuts? No!

**Adult Guides Discussion**:

**Questions**:
- "Could a hummingbird survive with a duck's beak?"
  * No - couldn't get nectar from flowers
- "Could a cardinal crack seeds with a hummingbird beak?"
  * No - too thin and weak
- "So each beak variation is good for...?"
  * Different situations/different foods
- "This is how variation helps survival!"

**Student Writes Summary**:
"Different beak shapes help birds survive because ___. A ___ beak is good for ___, but a ___ beak is good for ___. The variation in beaks means different birds can eat different foods and survive in different places."

---

#### Part 3: Building a Variation-Advantage Chart (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Create systematic chart linking variation to survival advantage

**Student Creates Chart** (template Section4_Survival_Advantages.pdf or in notebook):

```
VARIATION → SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE CHART

Organism: ___________
Habitat/Environment: ___________

Variation (Trait) | Advantage | Example
------------------|-----------|--------
                  |           |
                  |           |
                  |           |
```

**Student Researches 3 Examples**:

**Example 1: Giraffe Neck Length** (variation within giraffe population)
- Variation: Some giraffes have longer necks than others
- Advantage: Longer necks can reach higher leaves
- Survival benefit: More food available, less competition
- Can reproduce: Yes, because well-fed

**Example 2: Peppered Moth Color** (light vs dark)
- Variation: Some moths light colored, some dark
- Advantage: Dark moths blend in on dark trees, light moths on light trees
- Survival benefit: Better camouflage from birds
- Can reproduce: Yes, because not eaten

**Example 3: Arctic Fox Fur Color** (white vs brown)
- Variation: Fur color changes with season
- Advantage: White in winter (snow camouflage), brown in summer (ground camouflage)
- Survival benefit: Hard for predators to see, easier to hunt prey
- Can reproduce: Yes, because survives to adulthood

**Adult Helps Student Research** (10 minutes per example):
- Use simple online searches: "[animal] adaptation"
- Look at images
- Read simple descriptions
- Adult can read aloud if needed

**Student Documents Each Example**:
- Drawing or printed photo
- Labels showing the variation
- Written explanation of advantage

### Session 2: Constructing Explanations with Evidence (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Use evidence to construct scientific explanations for how variation provides survival advantages.

---

#### Part 1: Variation Simulation Activity (20 minutes)

**Activity**: Hands-on simulation showing how variation affects survival

**"Finding Food" Simulation**:

**Setup**:
- Scatter 20 small objects in yard or on floor (beans, small toys, buttons)
- Use 2 colors: 10 of one color, 10 of another
- Make one color match background (e.g., brown beans on brown floor)
- Make other color contrast (e.g., white beans on brown floor)

**Procedure**:
1. Student has 30 seconds to collect as many objects as possible
2. Count how many of each color collected
3. Objects NOT collected = "survived" (weren't eaten by predator)

**Data Collection**:
```
Starting:
Color 1 (matches background): 10
Color 2 (contrasts): 10

After "predation":
Color 1 collected: ___
Color 1 surviving: ___

Color 2 collected: ___
Color 2 surviving: ___
```

**Analysis**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Which color was easier to find?"
  * The one that contrasted with background
- "Which color survived better?"
  * The one that matched background (camouflage)
- "In nature, which color would reproduce more?"
  * The survivors - the camouflaged ones
- "Over time, would the population have more camouflaged or visible individuals?"
  * More camouflaged (they survive and reproduce)

**Student Writes**:
"This simulation shows that variation in color can affect survival. The ___ colored objects were harder to see, so they survived better. In nature, individuals with better camouflage would survive and have more offspring."

---

#### Part 2: Evidence-Based Argument Construction (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Build scientific argument using Claim-Evidence-Reasoning

**Choose One Organism to Analyze in Depth**:

**Student Selects** (or adult suggests):
- Zebra stripes
- Cheetah speed
- Cactus water storage
- Polar bear thick fur
- Chameleon color changing

**Research and Document** (15 minutes):
- What is the variation? (compared to other similar animals)
- What environment does it live in?
- What challenges does it face? (predators, food, weather)
- How does the variation help?
- Find at least 2 sources of information

**Write Formal Argument** (10-15 minutes):

**Template**:

**CLAIM**:
"The [specific variation] in [organism] provides a survival advantage."

Example: "The thick fur in polar bears provides a survival advantage."

**EVIDENCE** (at least 3 pieces):
1. [Fact about the environment]: "Polar bears live in Arctic where temperatures reach -40°F"
2. [Fact about the variation]: "Polar bear fur is 4 inches thick with dense undercoat"
3. [Fact about survival/reproduction]: "Thick fur keeps polar bears warm, allowing them to hunt seals and raise cubs in extreme cold"

**REASONING** (connect evidence to claim):
"This evidence supports my claim because:
- The Arctic environment is extremely cold
- Animals need insulation to survive in cold
- Thick fur provides better insulation than thin fur
- Better insulated bears can survive, hunt, and reproduce
- Therefore, thick fur variation gives survival advantage in Arctic environment"

**Student Writes Complete Argument** in neat format

---

#### Part 3: Variation and Reproduction Connection (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Understand that survival advantages lead to reproduction advantages

**Discussion**:

**Adult Explains with Questions**:
- "If an animal survives better, what can it do?"
  * Live longer, stay healthier
- "What do healthy adult animals do?"
  * Reproduce - have offspring
- "What traits will the offspring have?"
  * Similar to parents (remember Section 2 - inherited traits!)
- "So if a variation helps survival, what happens over time?"
  * More individuals in next generation have that helpful variation

**Case Study: Fast vs Slow Cheetahs**:

**Scenario**:
"Imagine a group of cheetahs. Some can run 60 mph, others only 45 mph."

**Student Predicts**:
- Which cheetahs catch more prey? (Faster ones)
- Which cheetahs are better fed? (Faster ones)
- Which cheetahs are healthier? (Faster ones)
- Which cheetahs are more likely to survive to adulthood? (Faster ones)
- Which cheetahs are more likely to have babies? (Faster ones)
- What speed will the babies likely have? (Fast - inherited from fast parents)
- Over many generations, would the population get faster or slower? (Faster)

**This demonstrates**: Survival advantage → Reproduction advantage → Trait passed to offspring → More common in population

**Student Creates Flow Chart**:
```
Variation exists
    ↓
Some variations help survival in environment
    ↓
Organisms with helpful variations survive better
    ↓
Survivors reproduce more
    ↓
Offspring inherit helpful variations
    ↓
Helpful variations become more common
```

---

#### Part 4: Real-World Application (10-15 minutes)

**Activity**: Find modern examples of variation and survival

**Student Researches One Current Example**:

**Options**:
1. **Antibiotic resistance in bacteria** (simple version):
   - Some bacteria have variation that resists medicine
   - When medicine used, resistant bacteria survive
   - They reproduce, making more resistant bacteria
   - Now harder to treat infections

2. **Pesticide resistance in insects**:
   - Some insects have variation making them resistant to pesticides
   - When pesticides sprayed, resistant ones survive
   - Population becomes more resistant over time

3. **Dog breeding** (human-directed variation):
   - Humans select dogs with desired traits
   - Breed them together
   - Puppies inherit those traits
   - How we got hundreds of breeds from wolves

4. **Climate change effects**:
   - Some organisms have variation helping them adapt to warmer temperatures
   - Those individuals surviving better as climate changes
   - Example: Some coral can tolerate warmer water

**Student Creates Mini-Presentation** (can be poster, paragraph, or verbal):
- What is the organism?
- What is the variation?
- What challenge/pressure exists?
- How does variation help?
- What happens over time?

## Extensions and Connections

**If Student Wants to Learn More**:

1. **Natural Selection Introduction** (age-appropriate):
   - Nature "selects" which variations survive
   - Over time, populations change
   - This is how new species can develop (very long time)

2. **Endangered Species**:
   - Research why some species struggle
   - Often: not enough variation to adapt to changes
   - Example: Cheetahs have very little genetic variation

3. **Artificial Selection**:
   - How humans bred crops and animals
   - Selecting desired traits over generations
   - Connection to farming and agriculture

4. **Mimicry**:
   - Some organisms copy dangerous ones
   - Harmless king snake looks like poisonous coral snake
   - Variation in appearance provides protection

5. **Local Wildlife**:
   - Observe local birds, insects, mammals
   - Notice variations in color, size, behavior
   - Hypothesize survival advantages

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't see how being different helps"**:
- Focus on specific examples with clear benefits
- Use the beak example - very concrete
- Do the camouflage simulation - hands-on proof
- Think about humans: different skills help in different jobs

**"Wouldn't being the same be better?"**:
- Discuss what happens if environment changes
- If all identical and environment changes, all might die
- Variation means some might survive in new conditions
- Example: If all birds had same beak, only one food source available

**"This seems like evolution - is that allowed?"**:
- NGSS includes evolution concepts at grade-appropriate level
- At 3rd grade: Focus on variation helping survival (observable)
- NOT covering: speciation, millions of years, human evolution
- Using scientific evidence to understand how organisms survive

**"I can't find good examples"**:
- Use provided examples (birds, moths, foxes, cheetahs)
- Look at PBS resources linked
- Use library books on animal adaptations
- Ask adult to help with age-appropriate sources
