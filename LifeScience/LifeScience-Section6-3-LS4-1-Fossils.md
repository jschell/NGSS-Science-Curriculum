## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Understanding Fossils as Evidence (75-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Learn what fossils are, how they form, and what evidence they provide about ancient organisms.

---

#### Part 1: Introduction - What Are Fossils? (15-20 minutes)

**Watch Together**:
- **Video**: "GPS: Dinosaurs" (first 3 minutes)
- **Link**: https://thinktv.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/32990d92-4917-4775-85f4-8749e9d79329/
- **Pause at 3:00**

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "What did the paleontologist do?"
  * Expected: Digs up fossils, studies them
- "What is a fossil?"
  * Student attempts definition
- "Why do scientists study fossils?"
  * To learn about ancient life

**Define Key Terms**:

**Student Records**:

**Fossil**: Remains or traces of organisms that lived long ago, preserved in rock
- Examples: Bones, teeth, shells, footprints, leaf imprints

**Paleontologist**: Scientist who studies fossils to learn about ancient life

**Extinct**: When all members of a species have died, and that organism no longer exists
- Example: Dinosaurs are extinct

**Ancient**: Very long ago, millions of years in the past

**Examine Fossil Images** (10 minutes):

**Adult Shows** (print or on screen):
- Dinosaur skeleton fossil
- Trilobite fossil (ancient sea creature)
- Fossilized leaf imprint
- Amber with insect inside
- Petrified wood
- Footprint fossil (trace fossil)

**For Each Image, Student Identifies**:
- What type of organism?
- What part is preserved?
- What can we learn from this?

**Student Creates Chart**:
```
Fossil Type | What It Shows | What We Can Learn
------------|---------------|-------------------
Bone        | Skeleton      | Size, shape, how it moved
Footprint   | Where walked  | How big, how it moved, behavior
Leaf        | Plant shape   | What plants existed, climate
Shell       | Sea creature  | Ocean life existed here
```

---

#### Part 2: How Fossils Form (20-25 minutes)

**Watch Video** (7 minutes):
- **Video**: "GPS: Dinosaurs" (segment 5:30-8:00)
- **Focus**: Fossil formation process

**Adult Explains Step-by-Step** (student draws each step):

**Fossil Formation Process**:

**Step 1: Organism Dies**
- Animal or plant dies
- Falls to ground or settles in water
- Student draws: Dead dinosaur on ground

**Step 2: Burial**
- Quickly covered by sediment (sand, mud, volcanic ash)
- Protects from scavengers and decomposition
- Student draws: Sediment covering dinosaur

**Step 3: Decay**
- Soft parts (skin, muscles) decay
- Hard parts (bones, teeth, shell) remain
- Takes hundreds to thousands of years
- Student draws: Only bones left in sediment

**Step 4: Mineralization**
- Minerals from water seep into bones
- Replace organic material with rock
- Bones turn to stone (petrification)
- Takes millions of years
- Student draws: Bones becoming rock

**Step 5: Uplift and Erosion**
- Layers of rock rise due to Earth's movements
- Weather and erosion wear away top layers
- Fossil becomes exposed
- Student draws: Fossil in rock layer being uncovered

**Step 6: Discovery**
- Paleontologist finds fossil
- Carefully excavates and studies
- Student draws: Scientist digging up fossil

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "How long does fossil formation take?"
  * Millions of years!
- "Why don't all dead organisms become fossils?"
  * Must be buried quickly
  * Right conditions needed
  * Most decay completely
- "What's needed for fossilization?"
  * Quick burial, sediment, water with minerals, time

**Key Understanding**: Fossils are RARE! Only special conditions create them.

---

#### Part 3: Fossils as Evidence (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Analyze what fossils tell us about organisms and environments

**Introduce Detective Work**:

**Adult Explains**:
"Paleontologists are like detectives. They use fossil clues to figure out:
- What the organism looked like
- How it lived (ate, moved, behaved)
- What environment it lived in
- When it lived"

**Evidence Analysis Practice**:

**Scenario 1: Dinosaur Teeth Fossils**

**Adult Shows Image** (find online: T. rex teeth vs. Brachiosaurus teeth)

**Student Observes and Infers**:
- Sharp, pointed teeth → What did it eat? (Meat - carnivore)
- Flat, grinding teeth → What did it eat? (Plants - herbivore)
- Big teeth → How big was the animal? (Large)

**Evidence**: Tooth shape tells us diet

---

**Scenario 2: Fish Fossil in Mountains**

**Adult Explains**:
"Fossil fish found in rocks on top of a mountain. How is this possible?"

**Student Hypothesizes**:
- Fish live in water
- Mountain has fish fossil
- Therefore...?

**Answer**: That area used to be underwater (ocean or lake)! Over millions of years, the land rose up and became mountains.

**Evidence**: Fossils tell us about ancient environments

---

**Scenario 3: Footprint Fossils**

**Adult Shows**: Dinosaur trackway (multiple footprints in a line)

**Student Analyzes**:
- How many toes? (Count)
- How far apart are prints? (Indicates size)
- Are they in a straight line or scattered? (Walking or running)
- Is there more than one set? (Group or solo)

**Evidence**: Footprints tell us about behavior and movement

---

**Scenario 4: Leaf Fossils**

**Adult Shows**: Fossilized tropical leaves found in cold region

**Student Infers**:
- Tropical leaves need warm, wet climate
- Found in place that's now cold
- Therefore...?

**Answer**: Climate was different in the past! That region used to be warm and tropical.

**Evidence**: Plant fossils tell us about ancient climate

---

**Student Creates Evidence Chart**:

```
WHAT FOSSILS TELL US

Type of Evidence | What It Reveals | Example
-----------------|-----------------|--------
Bones/skeleton   | Size, shape, structure | T. rex bones show large predator
Teeth            | Diet (what it ate) | Sharp teeth = carnivore
Footprints       | How it moved, behavior | Trackways show walking or running
Location         | Ancient environment | Fish fossils on mountain = used to be underwater
Plant fossils    | Ancient climate | Tropical leaves = warm climate long ago
Multiple fossils | Ecosystem | Many species together = diverse environment
```

---

### Session 2: Ancient Environments and Timelines (75-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Reconstruct ancient environments from fossil evidence and understand geological time.

---

#### Part 1: Case Study - Reconstructing an Ancient Environment (30 minutes)

**Activity**: Use multiple fossil clues to describe what an area was like millions of years ago

**Scenario**: "Paleontologists found these fossils in the same rock layer in your state"

**Adult Presents Fossil List**:
1. Fossilized fern leaves (large, tropical-type)
2. Fish fossils (freshwater species)
3. Crocodile-like reptile skeleton
4. Fossilized tree trunks (tall, straight)
5. Dragonfly wing imprints (very large - 2 feet wingspan!)
6. Coal deposits (fossilized plant material)

**Student Analyzes** (detective worksheet):

**Questions to Answer**:

1. **What organisms lived here?**
   - Ferns, fish, reptiles, trees, dragonflies
   - Student lists all

2. **What was the environment like?**
   - Water present? (Yes - fish fossils)
   - Type of water? (Freshwater - based on fish type)
   - Climate? (Warm - tropical plants, reptiles)
   - Plant life? (Lots of plants - ferns, trees, coal)
   - Student writes: "Warm, wet, swampy environment with freshwater"

3. **How is this different from today?**
   - Student compares to current local environment
   - Example: "Now it's dry with cold winters, but long ago it was like a tropical swamp!"

4. **When was this?**
   - Adult provides: "These rocks are about 300 million years old"
   - Before dinosaurs!
   - Student writes date

5. **Draw the ancient environment**:
   - Student creates illustration showing:
     * Swamp with water
     * Large ferns and trees
     * Fish swimming
     * Reptile on shore
     * Giant dragonflies flying
   - Label all organisms
   - Title: "[Your State] 300 Million Years Ago"

**Key Understanding**: Scientists piece together multiple clues to recreate ancient worlds!

---

#### Part 2: Geological Timeline Activity (30-35 minutes)

**Activity**: Create visual timeline showing when different organisms lived

**Setup**:

**Create Long Timeline**:
- Use long strip of paper (6-10 feet long)
- Or use hallway floor with tape
- Mark one end "TODAY" (0 years ago)
- Mark other end "4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO" (Earth formed)

**Scale** (simplified for 3rd grade):
- If timeline is 9 feet long
- Each foot = about 500 million years
- Helps visualize deep time

**Student Places Events on Timeline**:

**Adult Provides Index Cards with**:
1. Earth forms (4.5 billion years ago)
2. First life - bacteria (3.5 billion years ago)
3. First fish (500 million years ago)
4. First land plants (470 million years ago)
5. First insects (400 million years ago)
6. Dinosaurs appear (230 million years ago)
7. Dinosaurs go extinct (66 million years ago)
8. First humans (2 million years ago)
9. Today (0)

**Student Activities**:
- Place each card at correct spot on timeline
- Draw picture for each event
- Use yarn or string to connect related events
- Color code: Ocean life = blue, Land life = green, Extinction = red

**Discussion Points**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Which existed longer - dinosaurs or humans?"
  * Dinosaurs! (164 million years vs. 2 million years)
- "What's the biggest gap on the timeline?"
  * Early Earth with just bacteria - billions of years!
- "Did humans and dinosaurs live at the same time?"
  * NO! Dinosaurs went extinct 64 million years before humans appeared
- "How do we know this timeline?"
  * From fossils and dating rocks!

**Key Understanding**: Earth has a very long history. Different organisms lived at different times.

---

#### Part 3: Extinction and Change Over Time (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Understand that some organisms went extinct while others still exist

**Create Comparison Chart**:

```
EXTINCT vs. STILL LIVING

Extinct (only know from fossils) | Still Living Today
---------------------------------|-------------------
Dinosaurs (T. rex, Triceratops) | Birds (related to dinosaurs!)
Trilobites                       | Horseshoe crabs (similar)
Woolly mammoths                  | Elephants (related)
Saber-toothed cats              | Modern big cats
Giant ground sloths             | Tree sloths
```

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Why did some organisms go extinct?"
  * Environment changed (climate, food, disasters)
  * Couldn't adapt
  * Mass extinction events (like asteroid that killed dinosaurs)
- "Why do some organisms still exist?"
  * Adapted to changes
  * Found new environments
  * Had helpful variations (remember Section 4!)
- "Could organisms alive today become fossils in the future?"
  * Yes! Fossilization is still happening
  * Takes millions of years

**Connection to Previous Learning**:
- Section 4: Variation and survival
- If environment changes and organism can't adapt → extinction
- Fossils show us many organisms that couldn't survive changes

**Student Writes**:
"Fossils show us that many organisms that lived long ago are now extinct. They died out because ___. Some organisms are still alive today because ___. This shows that Earth's life has changed over millions of years."

### Session 3 (Optional Extension): Create Fossil Models (45-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Understand fossil formation through hands-on modeling.

---

#### Activity: Make Imprint Fossils

**Materials**:
- Clay, playdough, or salt dough
- Small objects: shells, leaves, plastic dinosaurs, coins, keys
- Rolling pin or bottle
- Wax paper

**Procedure**:

**Student Creates**:
1. Roll out clay flat (about 1/2 inch thick)
2. Press object firmly into clay
3. Carefully remove object
4. Observe imprint (this is like a fossil!)
5. Let dry (if using salt dough)

**Create Multiple "Fossils"**:
- Leaf imprint
- Shell imprint
- "Dinosaur" footprint (toy pressed in)
- Hand or finger print

**Analysis**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "What can you tell about the object from just the imprint?"
  * Shape, size, texture
- "What information is missing?"
  * Color, smell, how it moved
- "How is this like real fossils?"
  * Real fossils are also just imprints or hard parts
  * Scientists must infer the rest

**Optional: Plaster Casting**:
- Make clay imprint
- Pour plaster into imprint
- Let harden
- Remove to see 3D fossil-like model

5. **Living Fossils**:
   - Organisms that have barely changed (coelacanth, horseshoe crab, ginkgo tree)
   - Why have they survived so long?

---

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't understand millions of years"**:
- Use timeline visualization (very helpful!)
- Compare to student's age: "You're 8 years old. Dinosaurs lived 66 million years ago. That's 8 million times longer than you've been alive!"
- It's okay if it feels abstract - it is!

**"How do we know when fossils are from?"**:
- Scientists date rocks using special methods
- Different rock layers = different times
- Deeper layers = older
- Simplified explanation is fine for 3rd grade

**"Did humans really not live with dinosaurs?"**:
- Definitely not! Movies and cartoons are wrong
- 64 million year gap
- Timeline shows this clearly
- Humans are very recent

**"Why don't we find all species as fossils?"**:
- Fossilization is rare
- Most organisms decay completely
- Only certain conditions preserve fossils
- We've found many, but not all
