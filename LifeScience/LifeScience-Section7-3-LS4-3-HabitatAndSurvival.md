# Section 7: Habitat and Survival
**Standard**: 3-LS4-3
**Time**: 2-3 hours over 2 sessions

## Performance Expectation
Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.

---

## SETUP

### Materials Needed (gather before starting)

**Common Household Items**:
- Science notebook or printer paper
- Pencils, colored pencils, markers
- Index cards (20-30)
- Poster board or large paper
- Scissors
- Glue or tape
- Access to computer/tablet for research

**Optional**:
- Photos or drawings of different habitats and organisms
- Nature magazines for cutting out pictures

---

### Adult Prep (15 minutes)

**Before Session 1**:

1. **Research Habitats** (10 minutes):
   - Familiarize yourself with basic habitat types:
     * Desert, Rainforest, Ocean, Arctic, Grassland, Forest
   - Think about local habitat (where you live)
   - Find images online to show student

2. **Consider Examples** (5 minutes):
   - What organisms are suited to different habitats?
   - Polar bear (Arctic) - wouldn't survive in desert
   - Cactus (desert) - wouldn't survive in ocean
   - Think of clear, contrastingexamples

**Note**: This section builds on previous learning about variation (Section 4) and environmental effects (Section 3). Organisms have traits that match their habitat.

---

### Student Prep (10 minutes)

**What Student Does**:
1. Set up science notebook:
   - New page titled "Habitat and Survival"
   - Question: "Why can some organisms live in certain places but not others?"

2. Brainstorm:
   - List different places animals live (ocean, forest, desert, etc.)
   - List animals for each place
   - Initial thoughts: "Why does each animal live there?"

3. Personal connection:
   - "What habitat do I live in?"
   - "What plants and animals live near me?"

## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Habitat Matching and Survival Needs (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Identify organism survival needs and match organisms to appropriate habitats.

---

#### Part 1: What is a Habitat? (15 minutes)

**Introduction**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Where do you live?"
  * Student answers: house, apartment, city, etc.
- "What do you need to survive in your home?"
  * Food, water, shelter, warmth, safety
- "Animals need the same things! Their 'home' is called a habitat."

**Define**:

**Habitat**: The natural environment where an organism lives
- Provides: Food, water, shelter, space, right temperature
- Examples: Desert, ocean, forest, grassland, Arctic, rainforest

**Survival Needs** (all organisms need):
1. **Food** (energy to live)
2. **Water** (to drink, for body functions)
3. **Shelter** (protection from weather and predators)
4. **Space** (room to live, find food, raise young)
5. **Right climate/temperature** (not too hot, not too cold)

**Student Creates Checklist**:
```
SURVIVAL NEEDS CHECKLIST

For an organism to survive, habitat must provide:
□ Food (appropriate type for that organism)
□ Water (enough for drinking/living)
□ Shelter (protection)
□ Space (enough room)
□ Suitable climate (temperature, rainfall)

If habitat doesn't provide all these → organism cannot survive there
```

#### Part 2: Comparing Different Habitats (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Create habitat profile cards

**Student Researches 4 Different Habitats**:

**For Each Habitat, Document**:

**Template**:
```
HABITAT: _________

Climate:
- Temperature range: ___
- Rainfall: ___
- Seasons: ___

Available Resources:
- Water sources: ___
- Food types: ___
- Shelter options: ___
- Challenges: ___

Drawing of habitat: ___
```

**Example Habitats to Research**:

**1. Desert (Hot)**:
- Climate: Very hot days, cold nights, little rain
- Water: Very limited, occasional oases
- Food: Sparse plants, some insects, small animals
- Shelter: Burrows, under rocks, cacti
- Challenges: Extreme heat, very dry, limited food

**2. Arctic (Polar)**:
- Climate: Extremely cold, ice and snow, long dark winters
- Water: Ice/snow (not easy to drink)
- Food: Fish, seals, limited plants
- Shelter: Ice caves, snowbanks
- Challenges: Freezing temperatures, long winters

**3. Tropical Rainforest**:
- Climate: Hot and humid year-round, heavy rain
- Water: Abundant (rivers, rain)
- Food: Many plants, fruits, insects, animals
- Shelter: Trees, thick vegetation
- Challenges: Competition, many predators

**4. Ocean**:
- Climate: Varies by depth and location
- Water: Saltwater (everywhere, but not drinkable for land animals)
- Food: Fish, plankton, seaweed
- Shelter: Coral reefs, kelp forests, open water
- Challenges: Pressure, salt, predators, need to swim

**Student Creates Comparison Chart**:
```
Habitat    | Temperature | Water    | Food      | Main Challenge
-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------
Desert     | Very hot    | Scarce   | Limited   | Heat & dryness
Arctic     | Very cold   | Frozen   | Limited   | Extreme cold
Rainforest | Hot & humid | Abundant | Abundant  | Competition
Ocean      | Varies      | Salt water| Abundant | Must swim, salt
```

#### Part 3: Organism-Habitat Matching Game (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Match organisms to habitats and explain why

**Create Organism Cards**:

**Student Draws/Writes Cards** (12-16 organisms):

**Desert Organisms**:
- Cactus, camel, rattlesnake, scorpion

**Arctic Organisms**:
- Polar bear, penguin, arctic fox, seal

**Rainforest Organisms**:
- Monkey, parrot, tree frog, jaguar

**Ocean Organisms**:
- Fish, whale, octopus, seaweed

**Matching Activity**:

**Student Sorts Cards**:
- Place each organism with correct habitat
- For each, explain WHY it belongs there

**Example Reasoning**:
- **Polar bear → Arctic**: "Thick fur keeps warm in cold. White color camouflage in snow. Eats seals which live in Arctic. Would overheat in desert."
- **Cactus → Desert**: "Stores water in stem. Needs little rain. Tolerates extreme heat. Would rot in rainforest with too much water."
- **Whale → Ocean**: "Needs to swim (fins, tail). Breathes air but lives in water. Eats ocean food. Cannot live on land."

**Challenge Questions** (Adult asks):
- "Could a polar bear survive in the rainforest? Why or why not?"
  * No - too hot, no ice/snow, different food, would overheat
- "Could a monkey survive in the Arctic? Why or why not?"
  * No - too cold, no trees, can't find tropical fruits, would freeze
- "What would happen if you put a cactus in the ocean?"
  * Would die - too much water, salty, no soil, wrong conditions

**Student Writes Rule**:
"Organisms can only survive in habitats that meet their specific needs. Each organism has adaptations (special traits) that help it live in its habitat."

### Session 2: Argument Construction with Evidence (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Build evidence-based arguments about habitat suitability for different organisms.

---

#### Part 1: Detailed Case Study (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Analyze one habitat in depth with multiple organisms

**Choose One Habitat**: Desert (clear examples)

**Student Researches/Documents**:

**DESERT HABITAT ANALYSIS**:

**Organisms That Survive WELL**:
1. **Camel**:
   - Adaptations: Stores fat in hump (energy), can go long time without water, thick eyelashes block sand
   - Survival rating: Excellent (10/10)
   - Evidence: Camels evolved in deserts, perfectly adapted

2. **Cactus**:
   - Adaptations: Stores water in stem, waxy coating prevents water loss, spines protect from animals
   - Survival rating: Excellent (10/10)
   - Evidence: Cacti thrive in deserts

3. **Rattlesnake**:
   - Adaptations: Hunts at night (cooler), burrows underground, doesn't need much water
   - Survival rating: Very good (9/10)
   - Evidence: Desert is natural habitat

**Organisms That Survive LESS WELL**:
4. **Dog** (domestic):
   - Challenges: Needs regular water, no shelter from heat, paws burn on hot sand, struggles to find food
   - Survival rating: Poor (3/10)
   - Evidence: Dogs can visit desert with human help, but can't survive alone

5. **Rabbit**:
   - Challenges: Needs more water than available, more food than sparse desert provides
   - Can survive: Only near water sources, burrows help
   - Survival rating: Moderate (5/10)

**Organisms That CANNOT Survive**:
6. **Penguin**:
   - Fatal problems: Needs cold, ice, ocean fish; would overheat immediately, no food source
   - Survival rating: Impossible (0/10)
   - Evidence: Complete mismatch

7. **Goldfish**:
   - Fatal problems: Needs water to live in, no water sources sufficient, would die quickly
   - Survival rating: Impossible (0/10)

**Student Creates Argument**:
```
CLAIM: In the desert habitat, some organisms survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.

EVIDENCE:
- Camels and cacti survive WELL because they have adaptations for heat and limited water
- Dogs and rabbits survive LESS WELL because they need more resources than desert provides
- Penguins and fish CANNOT survive because their needs completely don't match desert conditions

REASONING:
This evidence supports the claim because it shows organisms need specific conditions to survive. The desert provides certain conditions (hot, dry, limited water). Organisms adapted to these conditions thrive. Organisms adapted to different conditions (cold, wet) cannot survive. This proves that habitat suitability depends on organism needs matching habitat features.
```

---

#### Part 2: Create Survival Rating System (20 minutes)

**Activity**: Develop system for rating organism-habitat matches

**Student Designs Rating Scale**:

```
HABITAT SURVIVAL RATING SCALE

10/10 - Perfectly adapted, thrives
8-9/10 - Very well adapted, does great
6-7/10 - Adapted enough, survives okay
4-5/10 - Struggles, barely survives
2-3/10 - Very poor match, likely dies
0-1/10 - Cannot survive, impossible
```

**Apply to Different Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1**: Rate how well these organisms would do in **Rainforest**:
- Monkey: ___/10 (Expected: 10 - perfect habitat)
- Snake: ___/10 (Expected: 9 - many snakes live in rainforests)
- Cactus: ___/10 (Expected: 1 - too much water, would rot)
- Camel: ___/10 (Expected: 2 - too wet, wrong food, too humid)

**Scenario 2**: Rate for **Arctic**:
- Polar bear: ___/10 (Expected: 10)
- Seal: ___/10 (Expected: 10)
- Lizard: ___/10 (Expected: 0 - cold-blooded, would freeze)
- Tropical plant: ___/10 (Expected: 0 - would freeze)

**For Each Rating, Student Justifies**:
- Why this rating?
- What specific needs are met or not met?
- What adaptations help or hurt?

---

#### Part 3: Final Argument Presentation (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Create visual argument about habitat and survival

**Student Chooses Format**:

**Option 1: Poster**:
- Title: "Who Can Survive in [Habitat]?"
- Three columns: "Survive Well" | "Survive Less Well" | "Cannot Survive"
- Photos/drawings of organisms in each column
- Evidence labels explaining why

**Option 2: Venn Diagram**:
- Circle 1: "[Habitat] Survivors"
- Circle 2: "Organisms Needing Different Conditions"
- Overlap: "Can barely survive"
- Sort organisms into categories

**Option 3: Habitat Report**:
- Written report with sections:
  * Habitat description
  * Organisms that thrive (with evidence)
  * Organisms that struggle (with evidence)
  * Organisms that can't survive (with evidence)
  * Conclusion

**Required Elements** (any format):
- Clear claim statement
- At least 6 organisms categorized
- Specific evidence for each
- Reasoning connecting evidence to claim
- Visuals (drawings, photos, or diagrams)

## Extensions and Connections

**If Student Wants to Learn More**:

1. **Local Habitat Study**:
   - Observe your backyard or nearby park
   - What organisms live there?
   - Why is it suitable for them?

2. **Habitat Loss**:
   - What happens when habitats are destroyed?
   - Example: Rainforest deforestation
   - Connects to Section 8 (Environmental Change)

3. **Invasive Species**:
   - Organisms moved to new habitats by humans
   - Sometimes they thrive too much!
   - Example: Kudzu in American South

4. **Microhabitats**:
   - Small habitats within larger ones
   - Under rocks, in tree holes, tide pools
   - Specific conditions for tiny organisms

5. **Aquarium/Terrarium**:
   - Creating artificial habitat
   - What conditions needed?
   - Connects science to pet care

---

## Troubleshooting

**"All organisms seem like they could survive anywhere"**:
- Choose more extreme examples (Arctic vs. Desert)
- Focus on specific needs not met
- Think about what would kill the organism (heat, cold, no water)

**"I don't know enough about organisms"**:
- Use suggested animals (polar bear, camel, fish, etc.)
- Research together with adult
- Watch videos showing organisms in natural habitats
- Keep it simple - basic facts are enough

**"The rating system seems arbitrary"**:
- It's a tool for thinking, not exact science
- Focus on the reasoning, not the number
- Different ratings are okay if justified
- Main point: Some survive better than others
