# Life Science - Living Things and Their Environments
## 3rd Grade NGSS Home Learning Guide
### One Student + One Parent/Teacher Format

**Total Time**: 20-28 hours

## Overview

This unit explores how living things grow, develop, and interact with their environments. The student will investigate life cycles, heredity, variation, adaptation, and how organisms respond to environmental changes through hands-on observations, data collection, and evidence-based reasoning.

### Learning Approach
- **Adult Role**: Facilitator and co-investigator (not lecturer)
- **Student Role**: Active scientist conducting investigations
- **Format**: Hands-on investigations with guided questions
- **Assessment**: Portfolio of investigations, data, and designs
