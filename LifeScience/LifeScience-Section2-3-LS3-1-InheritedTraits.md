## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Family Traits Investigation (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Collect and analyze data showing that offspring inherit traits from parents, and discover that variation exists even within families.

---

#### Part 1: Introduction - What Are Traits? (15 minutes)

**Discussion Starter**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Look in the mirror. What color are your eyes?"
  * Student answers: brown, blue, green, hazel, etc.
- "Why do you think your eyes are that color?"
  * Expected: "I don't know" or "Born that way" or "Like my mom/dad"
- "Look at your hair. What color and texture is it?"
  * Student describes
- "Do you think these features appeared randomly, or did they come from somewhere?"

**Introduce Vocabulary**:
- **Trait**: A characteristic or feature of an organism (eye color, hair color, height, etc.)
- **Inherited Trait**: A trait passed from parents to offspring through genes
- **Offspring**: The children of parents (human babies, animal babies, plant seedlings)
- **Variation**: Differences in traits among individuals

**Examples of Inherited Traits**:

**Adult and Student Generate List**:
- Eye color
- Hair color and texture (straight, wavy, curly)
- Skin color
- Height (tall, short)
- Ear shape (attached or unattached earlobes)
- Dimples (have them or don't)
- Tongue rolling (can roll or can't)
- Hand dominance (right or left handed) - partially inherited
- Freckles
- Hair color patterns (like widow's peak)

**Test Some Traits** (5 minutes):
- Can you roll your tongue? (try to make tongue into U-shape)
- Are your earlobes attached or unattached? (look in mirror)
- Do you have dimples when you smile?
- Widow's peak hairline? (V-shape at forehead)

**Student Records**: List of observable traits in notebook

---

#### Part 2: Family Traits Data Collection (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Collect data on traits from family members

**Create Data Table**:

**Student Sets Up** (or use printed template Section2_Family_Traits_Data.pdf):

```
Family Traits Data Table

Trait          | Student | Parent 1 | Parent 2 | Sibling 1 | Sibling 2 | Other
---------------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------
Eye Color      |         |          |          |           |           |
Hair Color     |         |          |          |           |           |
Hair Texture   |         |          |          |           |           |
Height (cm)    |         |          |          |           |           |
Skin Tone      |         |          |          |           |           |
Freckles?      |         |          |          |           |           |
Dimples?       |         |          |          |           |           |
Earlobe Type   |         |          |          |           |           |
Tongue Roll?   |         |          |          |           |           |
```

**Data Collection Methods**:

**Method 1: Direct Observation** (preferred):
- Student observes family members who are present
- Asks them to demonstrate (can you roll your tongue?)
- Measures heights with tape measure
- Records observations

**Method 2: Photo Analysis**:
- Use family photos to observe traits
- Note: Some traits (tongue rolling) can't be seen in photos
- Good for eye color, hair color, general appearance

**Method 3: Interview**:
- Ask family members: "What color are your eyes?"
- "Can you roll your tongue?"
- Record their answers

**Student Collects Data** (20 minutes):
- Fill in table for available family members
- Okay if some cells are blank (not all family members available)
- Take photos if permitted (optional)

**Adult's Role**:
- Help student ask family members respectfully
- Remind student this is science, not judging appearance
- Assist with measurements
- Ensure data is recorded accurately

---

#### Part 3: Data Analysis - Finding Patterns (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Analyze data to find evidence of inheritance

**Student Examines Data Table**:

**Adult Guides with Questions**:

1. **"Which of your traits match your parents?"**
   - Student circles or highlights matching traits
   - Counts how many matches with each parent
   - Example: "I have brown eyes like Parent 1, curly hair like Parent 2"

2. **"Are you exactly like one parent, or a mix of both?"**
   - Expected: Mix of both, or mostly one but not exactly
   - Key idea: Inherit from BOTH parents

3. **"Look at siblings. Do they have the exact same traits as you?"**
   - Expected: Some same, some different
   - Key idea: Variation exists even in same family

4. **"What patterns do you notice?"**
   - Expected observations:
     * Children often have traits similar to parents
     * Sometimes children have trait from one parent, not the other
     * Siblings aren't identical (unless twins)

**Student Creates Visual**:

**Trait Inheritance Chart** (10 minutes):
- Draw simple family tree
- Student at bottom, parents above, grandparents above them (if data available)
- Use colored lines or symbols to show trait inheritance
- Example: Blue line = eye color path, Red line = hair color path

**Or Create Bar Graph**:
- X-axis: Family members
- Y-axis: Height in cm
- Shows variation in height across family

**Student Writes Evidence Statement** (5 minutes):

"Evidence that traits are inherited from parents:
1. My ___ [trait] is the same as my ___ [parent/relative]
2. My sibling and I both have ___ [trait] from our parents
3. Looking at the data, I can see that ___"

---

#### Part 4: Beyond the Family - Variation in Groups (15 minutes)

**Activity**: Understand that variation exists within species

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Do all humans have the exact same eye color?"
  * No - brown, blue, green, hazel, etc.
- "Why not, if we all inherit from parents?"
  * Different parents have different traits to pass on
- "Is there just one type of dog, or many?"
  * Many - breeds have different traits

**Student Brainstorms Examples** (10 minutes):

**Variation within same species**:
- Dogs: different sizes, colors, ear shapes, tail lengths
- Cats: different fur patterns, eye colors, sizes
- Apples: different colors (red, green, yellow), sizes, sweetness
- Flowers: different colors, petal numbers, sizes
- Humans: different heights, skin colors, hair types

**Choose One Example to Document**:

**Student Researches** (use photos online or books):
- Find 4-5 examples of same species with different traits
- Example: 4 different dog breeds
- Print or draw each one
- Label the traits that are different

**Create Comparison Chart**:
```
Same Species, Different Traits

All are: [Dogs/Apples/Roses/etc.]

Individual 1: [name/type] - Traits: ___
Individual 2: [name/type] - Traits: ___
Individual 3: [name/type] - Traits: ___
Individual 4: [name/type] - Traits: ___

What's the SAME: All are the same species
What's DIFFERENT: Size, color, shape, etc.
WHY: Inherited different traits from different parents
```

**Key Concept**: Variation is normal! Even within the same species, individuals have different traits because they inherited different combinations from their parents.

---

### Session 2: Plant Traits Investigation (75-90 minutes + ongoing observations)

**Objective**: Observe that plants also inherit traits from parent plants, and collect data on variation within plant offspring.

---

#### Part 1: Plant Trait Introduction (15 minutes)

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Do you think plants have parents too?"
  * Yes - parent plant makes seeds
- "If you plant a bean seed, what will grow?"
  * A bean plant (same species as parent)
- "Will all bean plants look exactly the same?"
  * Probably not - there might be variation

**Examine Seeds** (10 minutes):

**Activity**: Look closely at seeds before planting

**Student Observes 6-10 Bean Seeds**:
- Look at each seed
- Measure length with ruler
- Notice color variations
- Notice size differences
- Any cracks or markings?

**Record Observations**:
```
Seed Observation Data

Seed # | Length (mm) | Width (mm) | Color | Special Features
-------|-------------|------------|-------|------------------
1      |             |            |       |
2      |             |            |       |
3      |             |            |       |
[etc.]
```

**Adult Asks**:
- "Are all the seeds exactly identical?"
  * No - small differences in size, color
- "They all came from bean plants. Why aren't they identical?"
  * Variation - even offspring from same parent show differences
- "What do you predict the plants will look like?"

**Student Makes Predictions**:
- "I predict the plants will all look ___"
- "I think the height will be ___"
- "I think there will be differences in ___"

---

#### Part 2: Planting Investigation (30 minutes)

**Setup**: Plant seeds to observe offspring traits

**Materials Ready**:
- 6-10 small pots or cups (poke drainage holes in bottom)
- Potting soil
- Seeds (already observed)
- Water
- Labels (numbered 1-10 or named)
- Tray to catch water

**Student Plants Seeds** (20 minutes):

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Fill each pot with soil (leave 1 inch at top)
2. Make small hole in center (1 inch deep)
3. Place ONE seed in each hole
4. Cover with soil
5. Water gently until soil is moist
6. Label each pot (Seed #1, Seed #2, etc.)
7. Place all pots in sunny location
8. Take photo of setup

**Create Observation Schedule**:
- Water: Every 2-3 days (keep soil moist, not soaked)
- Observe: Every 2-3 days
- Measure: Once per week
- Duration: 2-3 weeks minimum

**Student Creates Observation Log** (10 minutes):

**Use template Section2_Plant_Traits.pdf or create in notebook**:

```
Plant Growth Observation Log

Date: ___ / ___ / ___

Plant # | Height (cm) | # of Leaves | Leaf Color | Special Notes
--------|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------
1       |             |             |            |
2       |             |             |            |
3       |             |             |            |
[etc.]

Overall observations:
What's growing well?
What's struggling?
Any surprises?
```

**Adult's Role**:
- Supervise planting
- Help with watering schedule
- Remind student to observe regularly
- Don't do it for them - guide only!

---

#### Part 3: Ongoing Observations (10-14 days, 5 minutes per observation)

**Every 2-3 Days**:

**Student Observes and Records**:
- Check if seeds have sprouted (usually 5-7 days)
- Note date of first sprouting
- Water if soil is dry
- Take photos showing progress

**Weekly Measurements** (once per week for 2-3 weeks):
- Measure height of each plant (from soil to tallest point)
- Count number of leaves
- Note leaf color (light green, dark green, yellowish)
- Note any differences (one plant taller, one more leaves, etc.)
- Record in observation log

**Student Notes Patterns**:
- Which plants are growing fastest?
- Which plants look healthiest?
- Are all plants identical?
- What variations do you see?

---

#### Part 4: Data Analysis and Conclusions (30-35 minutes)

**After 2-3 weeks of growth**:

**Activity**: Analyze plant data for evidence of inheritance and variation

**Step 1: Create Comparison Table** (10 minutes):

**Final Data Summary**:
```
Final Plant Comparison (Day ___)

Plant # | Height | # Leaves | Leaf Color | Health (1-5) | Notes
--------|--------|----------|------------|--------------|-------
1       |        |          |            |              |
2       |        |          |            |              |
[etc.]

Average Height: ___
Range: ___ to ___
Most Common Leaf Color: ___
```

**Step 2: Create Graph** (10 minutes):

**Bar Graph: Plant Height Comparison**
- X-axis: Plant numbers
- Y-axis: Height in cm
- Draw bar for each plant
- Title: "Bean Plant Height After ___ Days"

**Adult Asks**:
- "What does the graph show?"
  * Some plants taller, some shorter
- "Are all bars the same height?"
  * No - variation!

**Step 3: Answer Analysis Questions** (10 minutes):

**Student Writes**:

1. **"Did all the plants look exactly the same? Why or why not?"**
   - Expected: No, there were differences in height, leaf number, color
   - Reason: Variation exists even in offspring from same parent

2. **"What traits did ALL the plants share?"**
   - All were bean plants (same species as parent)
   - All had similar leaf shape
   - All grew toward light
   - Evidence of inheritance: offspring same species as parent

3. **"What traits were different among the plants?"**
   - Height varied
   - Number of leaves varied
   - Some grew faster than others
   - Evidence of variation: individuals differ

4. **"How is this similar to human families?"**
   - Children inherit from parents (same species)
   - But siblings aren't identical
   - Variation is normal

**Step 4: Evidence-Based Conclusion** (5 minutes):

**Student Writes Final Statement**:

"Evidence from Plant Investigation:

Plants inherit traits from parent plants because ___
[Example: All bean seeds grew into bean plants, not other plants]

Variation exists in plant offspring because ___
[Example: Even though all seeds came from bean plants, heights ranged from ___ to ___]

This shows that inheritance and variation both happen in nature."

### Session 3 (Optional Extension): Pet or Animal Traits (45-60 minutes)

**If student has pets or access to animal photos**:

---

#### Activity: Analyze Animal Family Traits

**Option 1: Family Pets**:
- If you have pets with known parents/siblings
- Compare traits
- Photos of puppy vs. adult, or kitten vs. cat
- Notice how offspring resemble parents

**Option 2: Research Animal Families**:
- Find photos online of animal parents with offspring
- Examples:
  * Dog breed parents with puppies
  * Cat with kittens
  * Horse with foal
  * Cow with calf
  * Bird with chicks

**Student Creates Comparison**:

**Photo Analysis** (or draw if no photos):
- Print or draw parent animal
- Print or draw offspring
- Label traits that match
- Label traits that differ

**Create Chart**:
```
Animal: ___________

Parent Traits:        Offspring Traits:      Inherited?
- Color: ___         - Color: ___           Yes/No
- Size: ___          - Size: ___            Yes/No (will grow)
- Ear shape: ___     - Ear shape: ___       Yes/No
- Fur pattern: ___   - Fur pattern: ___     Yes/No
```

**Student Writes**:
"The offspring inherited ___, ___, and ___ from the parent.
This is evidence that animals inherit traits from parents."

---

## COMPLETION CHECKLIST - Section 2

Student has completed when they have:

- [ ] **Family traits data table** with at least 5 traits across 3+ family members
- [ ] **Data analysis** identifying which traits match which family members
- [ ] **Evidence statement** explaining inheritance with specific examples

---

## Evidence of Understanding

**Student can**:
✓ Define "inherited trait" and give examples
✓ Collect and organize data on family traits
✓ Identify patterns showing traits are inherited from parents
✓ Explain that offspring are similar to but not identical to parents
✓ Provide evidence that variation exists within groups of same organism
✓ Compare plant offspring and identify both inherited traits and variation
✓ Use data to support explanations about inheritance

---

## Extensions and Connections

**If Student Wants to Learn More**:

1. **Dominant vs. Recessive Traits** (simplified):
   - Some traits are more common than others
   - Example: Brown eyes are more common than blue eyes
   - Research which traits are more common in humans

2. **Genetics Introduction**:
   - Traits are passed through "genes" (like instructions)
   - Each parent gives half the genes
   - That's why you're a mix of both parents

3. **Breed Diversity**:
   - Research how dog breeds were created
   - Humans selected for certain traits
   - Now we have hundreds of breeds!

4. **Twin Studies**:
   - Identical twins have same genes - very similar
   - Fraternal twins have different genes - more variation
   - Research famous twin studies

5. **Plant Breeding**:
   - How farmers select plants with best traits
   - Growing food with desired characteristics
   - Connection to agriculture

---

## Troubleshooting

**"My family won't participate"**:
- Use just yourself and willing family members
- Use pet family if available
- Focus more on plant investigation
- All approaches teach same concepts

**"My plants aren't growing"**:
- Check watering (too much or too little)
- Check sunlight (needs bright light)
- Check temperature (seeds need warmth)
- Some seeds may not sprout - that's okay, variation!
- If no plants grow, use research/photos of plant families

**"I don't see any variation in my plants"**:
- Look more closely - small differences count
- Measure carefully - even 1cm difference matters
- Check leaf color, stem thickness, leaf number
- Variation may be subtle but is usually present

**"All my traits match one parent only"**:
- Look at more traits - often find mix
- Some traits more obvious than others
- May have non-visible traits from other parent
- Variation can skip generations (grandparents)

## Three-Dimensional Learning Integration

**Science and Engineering Practices**:
- **Analyzing and Interpreting Data**: Organizing family and plant data in tables and graphs
- **Using Mathematics**: Measuring plant heights, calculating averages, creating graphs
- **Constructing Explanations**: Using evidence to explain how traits are inherited

**Disciplinary Core Ideas**:
- **LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits**: Organisms inherit traits from parents; variation exists among offspring
- **LS3.B: Variation of Traits**: Different organisms have different characteristics that can change

**Crosscutting Concepts**:
- **Patterns**: Patterns of similarity between parents and offspring
- **Cause and Effect**: Inheritance causes offspring to resemble parents
- **Scale, Proportion, Quantity**: Measuring and comparing quantitative traits (height, size)

---

**Time Investment Summary**:
- Session 1: 60-75 minutes
- Session 2: 75-90 minutes (setup + initial observations)
- Ongoing observations: 5 minutes every 2-3 days for 2-3 weeks
- Session 3 (optional): 45-60 minutes
- **Total**: 3-4 hours (plus brief daily observations)
