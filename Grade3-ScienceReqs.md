**3-ESS3-1** [Climate] [Engineering] [ESE]  
Make a claim about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of a weather-related hazard.

### Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science

#### **How do we engineer solutions to a problem?**

**Priority Standard: WA.3.ETS1**

**Performance Expectations:**

**3-5-ETS1-1**  
Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost.

**3-5-ETS1-2**  
Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.

**3-5-ETS1-3**  
Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved.

-----

### Environmental and Sustainability Education

#### **How do we work together to ensure a healthy environment and sustainable economy for future generations?**

**Priority Standard: WA.3.ESE.1**  
Through project-based learning, synthesize information from multiple sources about local ecological, social, and economic systems, collaborating with partners and tribes in ways that foster solutions to local environmental problems.

**Performance Expectations:**

**3.ESE.1-1**  
Cite multiple sources and perspectives in an analysis of and presentation about environmental sustainability in the community, considering values at the individual, community, and tribal level.

**3.ESE.1-2**  
Design an investigation on school grounds to gather, analyze, and present data about how the built environment of the school improves or reduces environmental quality (e.g. impacts on/benefits to water quality, air quality, biodiversity, waste).

**3.ESE.1-3**  
Gather, analyze, and evaluate information, building the knowledge, attitudes, and understanding needed to demonstrate personal and civic responsibility for improved environmental sustainability at the local level.
