#### Step 3: Tribal/Indigenous Perspective (45-60 minutes)

**What can we learn from indigenous environmental knowledge?**

**Important Context** (Adult Explains):

"Indigenous peoples (including Native American tribes) have lived sustainably on this land for thousands of years. They have deep knowledge about:
- Caring for the environment
- Using resources wisely
- Living in balance with nature
- Seeing humans as part of nature, not separate from it

Learning from indigenous perspectives helps us understand different ways of thinking about the environment and our relationship to it."

**Whose Land Are We On?**
- Look up: "Whose land [your city/state]" online
- Learn about the tribal nations whose traditional territory you live on
- This is important context, even if you don't research those specific tribes

**Research Focus**:
- What do indigenous peoples teach about relationship with nature?
- How did/do indigenous peoples care for similar environments?
- What traditional practices protected resources?
- What values guide indigenous environmental stewardship?

**Possible Sources**:
- Tribal nation websites (especially environmental/natural resources departments)
- Native-authored books about environmental topics
- Educational materials from Native organizations
- Museum websites with indigenous environmental information
- PBS or educational videos about indigenous environmental knowledge

**Good Starting Points**:
- Search: "[Local tribal name] environmental stewardship"
- Search: "Native American traditional ecological knowledge + [your topic]"
- Look for: Coast Salish environmental practices (Pacific Northwest), or relevant to your region

**Student Creates "Tribal/Indigenous Perspective" Page**:
```
TRIBAL/INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVE

Whose traditional land do we live on?
_____________________________

What indigenous peoples teach about [topic or environment generally]:
- _____________________________
- _____________________________

Traditional practices related to [topic]:
- _____________________________

Values and beliefs:
- _____________________________
- _____________________________

How is this perspective different from modern approaches?
- _____________________________

Sources: [List source numbers]
```

**Important Reminders**:
- We're learning FROM, not speaking FOR, indigenous peoples
- Use respectful published sources
- Acknowledge the source of knowledge
- Don't use stereotypes or romanticized views
- Focus on environmental wisdom, not costumes or generalizations

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't find tribal/indigenous perspective on my specific topic"**:
- Broaden to general indigenous environmental values and wisdom
- Look for traditional practices related to similar environments (forests, rivers, coast)
- Focus on relationship with nature and sustainability principles
- It's okay to discuss broader indigenous environmental philosophy

**"All sources say the same thing"**:
- Look for different types of sources (government, nonprofit, personal stories)
- Search for opinion pieces or debates
- Look at history: How has thinking changed over time?
- Different solutions reveal different values

**"I have too much information"**:
- Focus on answering your 3-5 research questions
- Choose best examples, not all examples
- Organize into the three perspective categories
- Save extra information for extensions

**"Student chose topic that's hard to research"**:
- Help narrow or redirect: "Let's focus on [specific aspect]"
- Connect to related topic with better resources
- It's okay to adjust topic in first week

**"Presentation taking too long"**:
- Simplify: Fewer words, more images
- Focus on key findings
- Adult can help organize and edit
- Poster might be faster than slideshow for some students
