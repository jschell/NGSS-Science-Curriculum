# Project 3: Personal Action and Civic Responsibility
**Standard**: 3.ESE.1-3
**Time**: 3-5 hours over 4-8 weeks (plus ongoing action)

## Performance Expectation
Gather, analyze, and evaluate information, building the knowledge, attitudes, and understanding needed to demonstrate personal and civic responsibility for improved environmental sustainability at the local level.

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What You'll Do

In this project, you'll become an environmental changemaker! You'll:
1. Identify an environmental issue YOU care about
2. Research what individuals and communities can do
3. Create a personal action plan
4. TAKE ACTION for at least 4 weeks
5. Track your progress and results
6. Reflect on impact and share learning
7. Demonstrate civic responsibility

This is **REAL environmental stewardship** - not just learning about the environment, but actively helping!

### Why This Matters

**Environmental sustainability needs everyone**:
- Individual actions add up to big change
- Personal experience builds lifelong habits
- Taking action makes you part of the solution
- Civic responsibility means caring for our shared world

You're not just a student learning about the environment - you're a **citizen** making it better!

---

## SETUP

### Materials Needed

**For Planning**:
- Science notebook or action journal
- Computer/tablet for research
- Calendar for tracking

**For Action** (depends on chosen action):
- Will vary based on project
- Most actions use materials you already have
- Low-cost or free

**For Documentation**:
- Camera or phone
- Progress tracking sheets
- Graph paper (for tracking data)

---

### Adult Prep (15 minutes)

**Before Starting**:

1. **Reflect on Family Environmental Values** (5 minutes):
   - What environmental actions does your family already take?
   - What environmental issues concern you?
   - What changes might be feasible for your household?
   - What could student lead?

2. **Consider Action Possibilities** (5 minutes):
   - What actions could student do independently (with support)?
   - What actions would entire family participate in?
   - What community connections might be possible?

3. **Prepare for Long-Term Commitment** (5 minutes):
   - This project requires 4-8 weeks of action
   - Daily or weekly actions needed
   - Adult role: Support and encourage, not enforce
   - It's okay if actions evolve or adjust

**Important**: Student must CHOOSE their own action (with guidance). Ownership is critical for sustained effort.

---

### Student Prep (15 minutes)

**What Student Does**:

1. **Reflect on Learning So Far** (10 minutes):
   - If completed Projects 1 & 2: What did you learn?

## Troubleshooting

**"Student losing motivation after 2-3 weeks"**:
- Normal! Talk about it openly
- Revisit why this matters
- Adjust actions if too difficult
- Celebrate small wins
- Find accountability partner
- Remember commitment, but show grace

**"Actions not having measurable impact"**:
- Impact might take longer to see
- Qualitative impact still counts (feelings, learning, habits)
- Community impact may be invisible but real
- Focus on effort and consistency
- Small actions add up over time

**"Family not supporting as expected"**:
- Have family meeting to discuss
- Adjust plan to what student CAN control independently
- Find alternate support (friends, mentors)
- Document family challenges as part of reflection
- Focus on student's personal commitment

**"Student wants to switch actions mid-project"**:
- Week 1-2: Okay to adjust
- Week 3+: Encourage finishing commitment, but can modify
- Complete current commitment first, then start new
- Discuss why - learning opportunity

**"Can't think of civic engagement action"**:
- Start small: Teach one family member
- Create simple poster
- Share at family gathering
- Write thank-you to environmental worker
- Civic engagement can be simple and local

**"Action successful but student doesn't feel different"**:
- Learning and experience ARE the change
- Habits take longer than 4-8 weeks to feel automatic
- Impact may be more visible to others
- Reflection helps recognize growth

---
