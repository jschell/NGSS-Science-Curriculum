# Project 2: Home Grounds Environmental Investigation
**Standard**: 3.ESE.1-2
**Time**: 4-6 hours over 2-4 weeks

## Performance Expectation
Design an investigation on school grounds to gather, analyze, and present data about how the built environment of the school improves or reduces environmental quality (e.g. impacts on/benefits to water quality, air quality, biodiversity, waste).

**Homeschool Adaptation**: Investigate YOUR home, yard, or neighborhood instead of school grounds.

In this project, you'll become an environmental scientist investigating your own environment! You'll:
1. Choose ONE environmental quality to study (water, air, biodiversity, OR waste)
2. Design your own scientific investigation
3. Collect data over 2-4 weeks
4. Analyze what helps and what hurts environmental quality
5. Propose improvements
6. Present your findings

### Why This Matters

Your home and neighborhood are part of the environment! Understanding how buildings, yards, and human activities affect environmental quality helps you:

```

---

#### Step 4: Identify Environmental Impacts (20 minutes)

**Student Evaluates**: "What helped or hurt environmental quality?"

```
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

Things that HELPED environmental quality:
(What made water cleaner, air better, more biodiversity, or less waste?)
- _____________________________
- _____________________________
- _____________________________

Things that HURT environmental quality:
(What made water dirtier, air worse, less biodiversity, or more waste?)
- _____________________________
- _____________________________
- _____________________________

The built environment's effect:
Buildings/pavement/structures [helped / hurt / both] because _____________________________

Natural features' effect:

## Troubleshooting

**"Weather not cooperating for data collection"**:
- Be flexible with schedule
- Extend timeframe if needed
- Some weather IS data (for water/air investigations)
- Focus on observations you can make

**"Not finding much biodiversity"**:
- Look closer - tiny insects count!
- Expand where you look
- Try different times of day
- Even low biodiversity IS a finding - why?

**"Data collection is taking too long"**:
- Reduce frequency (daily → every other day)
- Shorter observation periods (30 min → 15 min)
- Simplify what you're measuring
- Adult can help with recording

**"Results aren't clear or interesting"**:
- ALL data is interesting! Why might results be unclear?
- Smaller patterns still count
- "No difference" is a finding
- Focus on what you DID find

**"Student wants to change investigation mid-way"**:
- Okay if in first week!
- After that, better to complete and start new investigation
- Can add to investigation, but keep original plan too
- Document why you changed approach
