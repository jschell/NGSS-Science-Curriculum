# Environmental & Sustainability Education
## 3rd Grade NGSS Home Learning Guide
### One Student + One Parent/Teacher Format

**Total Time**: 12-18 hours (can span semester)
**Standards Covered**: 3.ESE.1-1, 3.ESE.1-2, 3.ESE.1-3

---

## Overview

This unit engages students in real-world environmental stewardship through project-based learning. Unlike other science units with structured sessions, this section is designed to **span the semester** while students apply learning to their local environment. Students will research environmental issues, investigate their home/yard/neighborhood, and take meaningful action for sustainability.

### Learning Approach
- **Adult Role**: Project facilitator and community connection guide
- **Student Role**: Environmental researcher and active citizen
- **Format**: Long-term projects with student choice and ownership
- **Assessment**: Action projects, presentations, and demonstrated civic responsibility

---

## Unit Sequence

**Recommended Approach: Three Integrated Projects**

This section works differently from Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth Science. Rather than completing sequential sessions, students work on three interconnected projects **throughout the semester**, often in parallel with other science learning.

**Project 1**: Environmental Sustainability Research and Presentation (3.ESE.1-1)
- **Time**: 5-7 hours spread over 3-4 weeks
- **Can pair with**: Life Science Section 8 (Environmental Change Solutions)

**Project 2**: Home Grounds Environmental Investigation (3.ESE.1-2)
- **Time**: 4-6 hours spread over 2-4 weeks
- **Can pair with**: Earth Science Section 1 (Weather observations)

**Project 3**: Personal Action and Civic Responsibility Project (3.ESE.1-3)
- **Time**: 3-5 hours spread over 4-8 weeks
- **Can pair with**: Any section - this is ongoing action

---

## Why This Section Is Different

### Project-Based Learning

Traditional science sections have structured 45-90 minute sessions with specific procedures. **This section doesn't work that way** because environmental stewardship is about:

✓ **Long-term engagement** - Change happens over time
✓ **Student choice** - Pick projects that matter to YOU
✓ **Real-world action** - Not just learning, but DOING
✓ **Community connections** - Learning from and with others
✓ **Integration** - Connects to everything else you're learning

### Flexibility for Homeschool

The standards mention "school grounds" but we adapt for homeschool by using:
- Your home and yard
- Your neighborhood
- Local parks or natural areas
- Community spaces (with adult supervision)

The standards mention "tribal perspectives" (important in Washington State). We approach this respectfully by:
- Learning from published tribal environmental teachings
- Acknowledging indigenous stewardship traditions
- Understanding that land has history
- Respecting that students may have varied cultural backgrounds

## Support for Adults

**This section requires different facilitation:**

### Your Role as Project Facilitator

**Instead of** teaching sessions with procedures:
- Help student identify interests and questions
- Connect student to resources and experts
- Support long-term planning and follow-through
- Facilitate community connections (safely)
- Encourage reflection and adjustment

**Adult responsibilities**:
- ✅ Help student choose appropriate projects
- ✅ Ensure safety in investigations and community contacts
- ✅ Provide access to research materials
- ✅ Check in weekly on progress
- ✅ Celebrate small steps and sustained effort
- ✅ Model environmental responsibility

**You don't need to**:
- ❌ Be an environmental expert
- ❌ Know all the answers
- ❌ Have connections to tribal communities (respectful research is fine)
- ❌ Make the projects "perfect"
- ❌ Require sophisticated investigations

## Pacing Recommendations

### Option 1: Semester-Long Integration (Recommended)

**Weeks 1-4**: Start Project 1 (Sustainability Research)
- Week 1: Choose topic, begin research
- Week 2-3: Continue research, multiple perspectives
- Week 4: Create presentation, present

**Weeks 3-7**: Start and Complete Project 2 (Home Investigation)
- Week 3: Design investigation
- Weeks 4-6: Collect data
- Week 7: Analyze and present

**Weeks 5-12+**: Start and Continue Project 3 (Personal Action)
- Week 5-6: Research and plan
- Weeks 7-12+: Implement and track (ongoing)
- Can continue beyond semester!

**Overlap is intentional** - Real environmental work isn't linear.

### Option 2: Intensive Environmental Unit (4-6 weeks)

Complete all three projects in sequence:
- Weeks 1-2: Project 1
- Weeks 2-4: Project 2
- Weeks 4-6+: Project 3 (continues beyond unit)

### Option 3: Integrated with Other Sciences

Embed ESE projects within other science units:

## Important Notes for Families

### Tribal Perspectives (Washington State Context)

Washington State standards include tribal perspectives because:
- Indigenous peoples have 10,000+ years of sustainable living on this land
- Tribal nations are sovereign governments with environmental expertise
- Traditional ecological knowledge offers valuable insights
- Respect for diverse cultural values is important

**How to include respectfully**:
- Use published resources, tribal websites, educational materials
- Acknowledge whose traditional land you live on
- Focus on learning, not appropriating
- Don't speak for tribal communities - learn from their voices

**Good resources**:
- Tribal nation websites (environmental departments)
- Native environmental education materials
- Books by Native authors about traditional environmental practices
- Museum exhibits and educational programs

**Not appropriate**:
- Claiming to represent tribal perspectives
- Using stereotypes or romanticized views
- Taking without acknowledgment

### Community Engagement Safely

Projects may involve:
- Interviewing community members
- Visiting public spaces
- Participating in community events

**Safety guidelines**:
- Adult accompanies student always
- Pre-approve all contacts and locations
- Use phone/video for interviews if safer
- Respect private property
- Check in regularly during longer outings

### Making It Meaningful

The **best** ESE learning happens when:
- Student chooses projects they care about
- Actions are authentic (not just for school)
- Results matter beyond the grade
- Student sees themselves as capable of making a difference
- Family participates together

This is **citizen science** and **civic engagement** - the student is a real environmental researcher and steward!

---

## Questions or Modifications?

These projects are designed to be flexible. Feel free to:
- Adjust timelines based on student engagement
- Choose project topics relevant to your location
- Scale complexity up or down
- Combine projects if natural connections emerge
- Continue projects beyond the "required" time if student is invested
- Adapt for urban, suburban, or rural settings

The goal is **authentic environmental engagement** that builds lifelong stewardship values and skills!
