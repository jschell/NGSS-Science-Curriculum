### Adult Prep (20 minutes)

**Before Session 1**:

1. **Review Weather vs. Climate** (5 minutes):
   - **Weather**: Short-term (days/weeks) - changes frequently
   - **Climate**: Long-term (years/decades) - typical pattern for a region
   - **Example**: "Today is rainy (weather), but Arizona has a dry climate"
   - **Why This Matters**: Student needs to understand the difference

2. **Explore Climate Resources** (10 minutes):
   - **Resource**: "Weather & Climate Collection | NASA-funded"
   - **Link**: https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/universe/topic/weather-climate/
   - **Browse**: Climate-related videos and images
   - **What to Note**: Examples of different climate types with clear visuals

3. **Find World Climate Map** (5 minutes):
   - Search "world climate zones map for kids"
   - Bookmark a simple, clear version
   - Common zones: Tropical, Desert, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean
   - Student will create their own version

**Note**: This section works well after Section 1 (Weather Patterns) because student understands weather data and can now learn how climate is the pattern of weather over long periods.

---

### Student Prep (10 minutes)

**What Student Does**:
1. Set up science notebook:
   - New page titled "Climate Regions"
   - Today's date
   - Question: "Why are some places hot and others cold?"

2. Think about places you know:
   - Where do you live?
   - Other places you've visited or heard about?
   - How is the weather different in those places?

3. Initial ideas:
   - "What do you think makes a climate?"
   - "Why might different places have different climates?"

## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Weather vs. Climate and Climate Research (75-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Understand difference between weather and climate, then research different climate regions.

---

#### Part 1: Weather vs. Climate (20 minutes)

**Introduction**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "In Section 1, you observed weather for several weeks. Did the weather change every day?"
  * Yes - some days warm, some cool, some rainy, etc.
- "But overall, was there a PATTERN?"
  * Yes - typical for the season

**Define Climate**:

**Student Writes**:
```
WEATHER VS. CLIMATE

WEATHER:
- Day-to-day conditions
- Changes frequently
- What's happening RIGHT NOW
- Example: "Today is rainy and 50°F"

CLIMATE:
- Average pattern over many years (30+ years)
- Stays fairly consistent
- What's TYPICAL for a place
- Example: "Seattle has a rainy climate"

Key Idea: Climate is what you EXPECT
         Weather is what you GET
```

**Real-World Examples**:

**Adult Provides Examples** (or student brainstorms):
- "Florida has a WARM, HUMID climate, but today might be cool (weather)"
- "Alaska has a COLD climate, but can have a warm day in summer (weather)"
- "Arizona has a DRY climate, but it rained yesterday (weather)"

**Student Understanding Check**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Is 'sunny today' weather or climate?"
  * Weather (today = short-term)
- "Is 'hot summers and cold winters' weather or climate?"
  * Climate (pattern over time)
- "If you visit Hawaii, what climate would you expect?"
  * Warm and tropical (even if one day might be rainy)

---

#### Part 2: World Climate Map (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Create and color world climate map

**Student Colors** (use Section2_World_Climate_Map.pdf or printable world map):

**Color Key**:
- **Red/Orange** = Tropical (hot, wet)
- **Yellow** = Desert (dry)
- **Green** = Temperate (moderate)
- **Blue** = Polar (cold)
- **Purple** = Mediterranean (bonus if learned)

**Regions to Color**:
- **Tropical**: Band near equator (Amazon, Congo, Southeast Asia)
- **Desert**: Sahara, Arabian, Australian interior, Southwest USA
- **Temperate**: Much of USA, Europe, parts of Asia
- **Polar**: Antarctica, Arctic, northern Canada, northern Russia

**Map Tips**:
- Use reference climate map from internet
- Adult helps locate regions
- Color neatly to show clear zones
- Add title: "World Climate Zones"

**Student Observations**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "What pattern do you notice?"
  * Hot climates near equator, cold near poles
- "Why do you think this pattern exists?"
  * Sun's rays more direct at equator
  * Poles get less direct sunlight
- "Are there deserts in cold places?"
  * Yes! Antarctica is technically a cold desert (very dry)

#### Part 3: Climate and Living Things (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Analyze how climate affects organisms

**Student Creates Connection Chart**:

```
CLIMATE → LIVING THINGS

Tropical Climate:
- Lots of rain → Rainforests grow
- Hot all year → No need for warm fur
- Example animals: Monkeys, parrots, jaguars, tree frogs
- Example plants: Palm trees, vines, orchids

Desert Climate:
- Very little water → Plants store water (cacti)
- Hot days, cold nights → Animals burrow underground
- Example animals: Camels, lizards, snakes, scorpions
- Example plants: Cacti, succulents, drought-resistant shrubs

Temperate Climate:
- Four seasons → Animals adapt to changes
- Moderate rain → Variety of plants
- Example animals: Deer, squirrels, robins, bears
- Example plants: Deciduous trees, grasses, flowering plants

Polar Climate:
- Very cold → Thick fur or blubber needed
- Ice and snow → White camouflage helps
- Example animals: Polar bears, penguins, seals, arctic foxes
- Example plants: Mosses, lichens, small hardy plants
```

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Could a polar bear survive in the desert? Why not?"
  * Too hot, no food, thick fur would overheat it
- "Could a cactus grow in the rainforest? Why not?"
  * Too much water - it would rot
- "Why do animals and plants look different in different climates?"
  * They have adaptations to survive in their climate

**Connection to Previous Learning**:
- Links to Life Science Section 7 (Habitat and Survival)
- Climate is a BIG part of what makes a habitat

- "What was most surprising thing you learned?"
- "How do people adapt to live in very hot or very cold climates?"

---

#### Part 3: Why Are Climates Different? (10-15 minutes)

**Discussion of Climate Causes**:

**Adult Explains** (age-appropriately):

**Three Main Factors**:

**1. Distance from Equator (Latitude)**:
- Sun's rays hit equator directly → hot
- Sun's rays hit poles at angle → cold
- This is why we have climate zones in bands

**2. Distance from Ocean**:
- Near ocean → moderate temperatures, more moisture
- Far from ocean → extreme temperatures, less moisture
- Oceans help regulate temperature

**3. Elevation (Height)**:
- High mountains → colder even near equator
- Example: Mount Kilimanjaro has snow at top even though it's in Africa near equator
- Higher = colder

**Student Understanding Check**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Why is it hot near the equator?"
  * Sun's rays are most direct there
- "Why is Antarctica so cold?"
  * At South Pole, far from equator
- "Why might a coastal city have milder climate than inland city at same latitude?"
  * Ocean moderates temperature

**Simple Diagram** (optional):

Student draws:
- Earth with equator labeled
- Sun's rays hitting Earth
- Straight rays at equator (labeled "hot")
- Angled rays at poles (labeled "cold")

#### Part 4: Reflection and Personal Connection (5-10 minutes)

**Student Writes**:

```

## Troubleshooting

**"All the climates seem similar"**:
- Focus on extremes first (polar vs. tropical)
- Use visuals - photos help show dramatic differences
- Discuss: "Would you need a winter coat in the Amazon?"

**"I can't find climate data for kids"**:
- Try: "climate facts for kids + [region name]"
- National Geographic Kids has good resources
- Weather.com has climate averages for cities
- Library books about different countries/regions

**"Student confuses weather and climate"**:
- Use concrete examples from their life
- "Today's weather is ___, but our climate is ___"
- Reinforce: Weather = what's happening now, Climate = pattern over years
- Review with daily weather: "Today is unusually hot - does this change our climate?"

**"World map is too complex"**:
- Use simplified climate zone map
- Just color 3-4 main zones (hot/tropical, moderate/temperate, cold/polar)
- Focus on pattern: hot near equator, cold at poles
- Don't worry about every detail

**"Research taking too long"**:
- Limit to 2-3 regions instead of 4
- Provide pre-selected websites to student
- Adult can help find information
- Use template to keep research focused
