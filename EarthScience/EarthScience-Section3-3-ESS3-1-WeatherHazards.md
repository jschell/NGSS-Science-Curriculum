### Adult Prep (20 minutes)

**Before Session 1**:

1. **Identify Local Hazards** (10 minutes):
   - What weather hazards affect YOUR area?
     * Hurricanes? (coastal areas)
     * Tornadoes? (Midwest, South)
     * Flooding? (many regions)
     * Drought? (Southwest, California)
     * Wildfires? (dry, forested areas)
     * Blizzards/ice storms? (Northern states)
     * Heat waves? (many regions)
   - **Student will research 1-2 relevant hazards**
   - **Why**: Makes learning personally relevant

2. **Find Local Examples** (5 minutes):
   - Recent news about weather impacts in your area
   - Historical examples (past storms, floods, etc.)
   - How did community respond?
   - **Why**: Real examples make abstract concepts concrete

3. **Review Engineering Design** (5 minutes):

   - Steps: Define problem → Criteria/Constraints → Brainstorm → Evaluate
   - This section applies engineering to weather hazards
   - **Why**: Student will evaluate existing solutions using engineering thinking

**Note**: This section integrates engineering with Earth science. Focus on EVALUATING solutions (not necessarily designing from scratch, though that's an extension option).

2. Brainstorm weather hazards:
   - What dangerous weather have you heard about?
   - What dangerous weather happens near you?
   - How do people prepare?

3. Personal experience:
   - Have you experienced any dangerous weather?
   - What did your family do to stay safe?

#### Part 1: What are Weather Hazards? (20 minutes)

**Introduction**:

**Adult Asks**:

**Define Weather Hazard**:

**Student Writes**:
```
WEATHER HAZARD

Definition: Weather events that can harm people, damage property, or disrupt communities

Examples of Weather Hazards:
- Hurricanes: Very strong storms with high winds and heavy rain
- Tornadoes: Violently rotating columns of air
- Floods: Too much water covering normally dry land
- Droughts: Long periods with very little rain
- Blizzards: Severe snowstorms with strong winds
- Heat Waves: Dangerously hot temperatures for days
- Wildfires: Often caused/worsened by drought and wind
```

**Watch Examples** (optional, 10 minutes):

### Session 2: Solutions Research and Evaluation (75-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Research existing solutions to weather hazards and evaluate their effectiveness.

---

#### Part 1: Types of Solutions (15 minutes)

  * Emergency alert systems
  * Tornado sirens

2. PROTECTION AND PREVENTION
- Goal: Reduce damage when hazard occurs
- Examples:
  * Building codes (stronger buildings)
  * Levees and dams (flood protection)
  * Firebreaks (stop wildfire spread)
  * Storm shelters
  * Seawalls (hurricane protection)

3. PREPARATION AND RESPONSE
- Goal: Help people stay safe
- Examples:
  * Emergency kits
  * Evacuation plans
  * Emergency shelters

  * Community preparedness programs
```

**Adult Asks**:
- "Which type of solution do you think is most important?"
  * All three work together!
- "Can we STOP hurricanes or tornadoes?"
  * No - but we can reduce their impacts

---

#### Part 2: Solutions Research (30-35 minutes)

**Activity**: Research specific solutions for each hazard

---

#### Part 3: Evaluation Using Criteria (25-30 minutes)

**Activity**: Evaluate solutions using engineering criteria

**Student Creates Evaluation Matrix**:

```
SOLUTION EVALUATION MATRIX
For: [Hazard Name]

Criteria (what matters):
1. Saves lives ✓
2. Reduces property damage ✓
3. Affordable (doesn't cost too much) ✓
4. Easy to implement (can actually do it) ✓
5. Works reliably (works every time) ✓

Rate each solution 1-5 stars for each criterion:
```

| Solution | Saves Lives | Reduces Damage | Affordable | Easy to Do | Reliable | TOTAL |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| #1       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ___/25 |
| #2       | | | | | | ___/25 |
| #3       | | | | | | ___/25 |
| #4       | | | | | | ___/25 |

**Student Rates Each Solution**:
- Be honest about pros and cons
- Use research evidence
- Add up total stars

**Analysis Questions**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Which solution scored highest?"
- "Does highest score always mean best solution?"
  * Not always - sometimes need multiple solutions working together
- "What if a solution saves many lives but is very expensive?"
  * Trade-offs exist - discuss values and priorities
- "Do we need just ONE solution or several?"
  * Usually need combination (prediction + protection + preparation)

---

### Session 3: Claims and Recommendations (45-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Make and defend claim about merit of a solution using evidence.

---

#### Part 1: Making a Claim (20-25 minutes)

**Activity**: Write evidence-based claim about solution effectiveness

**Claim Framework**: Claim → Evidence → Reasoning

**Student Writes for Each Hazard**:

```
SOLUTION CLAIM

Hazard: _______________

CLAIM:
"The solution of [specific solution] has merit for reducing impacts of [hazard] because it [brief reason]."

EVIDENCE:
1. This solution saves lives by _____
   - Example: _____
   - Data/fact: _____

2. This solution reduces property damage by _____
   - Example: _____
   - Data/fact: _____

3. This solution is effective because _____
   - Evidence: _____
   - Has been used successfully in: _____

REASONING:
"This evidence supports my claim that [solution] has merit because [connect evidence to claim]. Even though this solution has limitations like [acknowledge drawbacks], the benefits of [list benefits] make it valuable for protecting people from [hazard]. This solution works best when combined with [other solutions]."

TRADE-OFFS:
"One limitation is _____, but this is outweighed by _____ because _____."
```

**Example Claim - Hurricane Warning Systems**:

**CLAIM**:
"The solution of hurricane tracking and early warning systems has merit for reducing impacts of hurricanes because it gives people time to evacuate and prepare."

**EVIDENCE**:
1. Warning systems save lives by giving 24-48 hours notice
   - Example: Hurricane warnings allow millions to evacuate safely
   - Fact: Death rates from hurricanes have decreased dramatically since 1950s when tracking improved

2. Warnings reduce property damage by allowing preparation
   - People can board up windows, move valuables, secure outdoor items
   - Communities can position emergency responders

3. Technology is highly effective
   - NOAA Hurricane Center tracks storms with satellites and aircraft
   - Predictions are 85%+ accurate for 3-day forecasts

**REASONING**:
"This evidence supports my claim that hurricane warning systems have merit because they directly lead to lives saved and reduced damages. Even though warnings can't stop the hurricane itself, the benefits of giving people time to prepare and evacuate make this solution extremely valuable. Warning systems work best when combined with evacuation plans and strong building codes."

---

#### Part 2: Compare Solutions (15-20 minutes)

**Activity**: Compare different approaches

**Student Creates Comparison**:

```
SOLUTION COMPARISON

Best for Saving Lives: _____
Why: _____

Best for Property Protection: _____
Why: _____

Most Affordable: _____
Why: _____

Easiest to Implement: _____
Why: _____

Most Reliable: _____
Why: _____

OVERALL BEST SOLUTION: _____
Why this solution has the most merit: _____

RECOMMENDED COMBINATION:
"The ideal approach would combine:
1. _____ (prediction/warning)
2. _____ (protection)
3. _____ (preparation)

This combination would be effective because _____."
```

**Discussion**:

**Adult Asks**:
- "Is there one perfect solution?"
  * Usually no - combinations work best
- "What if people can't afford expensive solutions?"
  * Important consideration - some solutions better than none
  * Community/government help needed for expensive protections
- "Do all solutions work in all places?"
  * No - solutions must match the specific hazard and location
