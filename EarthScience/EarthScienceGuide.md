## Overview

This unit explores weather patterns, climate in different regions, and how humans prepare for and respond to weather-related hazards. The student will collect real weather data, analyze patterns, research climate zones around the world, and apply engineering thinking to design solutions that reduce weather hazard impacts.

### Learning Approach
- **Adult Role**: Facilitator and co-investigator (not lecturer)
- **Student Role**: Active scientist conducting investigations
- **Format**: Hands-on investigations with guided questions
- **Assessment**: Portfolio of investigations, data, and designs

## Three-Dimensional Learning

Each section integrates all three dimensions of NGSS:

### Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)
- **Planning and Carrying Out Investigations** (daily weather observations)
- **Analyzing and Interpreting Data** (graphing weather data, comparing climates)
- **Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking** (measurements, averages, graphs)
- **Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information** (climate research)
- **Constructing Explanations** (weather patterns, climate differences)
- **Engaging in Argument from Evidence** (evaluating hazard solutions)

### Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
- **ESS2.D: Weather and Climate** - Patterns in weather, climate characteristics
- **ESS3.B: Natural Hazards** - Weather hazards and how to reduce impacts
- **ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions** - Evaluating solutions with criteria

### Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)
- **Patterns**: Weather patterns over time, seasonal patterns, climate patterns
- **Cause and Effect**: Weather conditions cause different climates, hazards cause impacts
- **Scale, Proportion, and Quantity**: Measuring weather, comparing data across regions
- **Systems and System Models**: Weather as system, climate zones as models
- **Stability and Change**: Daily weather changes, but climate is stable over time

---

## Support for Adults

**No science background needed!** Each section includes:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Exact questions to ask
- Expected student responses
- Troubleshooting tips
- Video resources to watch first
- Simple household materials only

**Adult Role**: You're a facilitator, not a teacher. Ask questions, guide observations, and let the student discover patterns and build explanations with your support.

---

## Pacing Recommendations

### Option 1: Sequential (Recommended)
Complete sections in order 1-3 over 4-6 weeks:
- **Weeks 1-3**: Section 1 (Weather Patterns) with daily observations
- **Week 4**: Section 2 (Climate Regions)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Section 3 (Weather Hazards)

### Option 2: Concurrent Start
Start Section 1 observations, then add other sections:
- **Week 1**: Begin daily weather observations (Section 1)
- **Week 2**: Continue observations + start Section 2 (Climate)
- **Week 3**: Continue observations + finish Section 2, start Section 3
- **Week 4**: Finish Section 1 analysis + complete Section 3

### Option 3: Seasonal Integration
Align with current season and local weather:
- **Fall/Spring**: Full sequence (best weather variety)
- **Winter**: Focus on seasonal patterns and storm hazards
- **Summer**: Compare summer to other seasons using past data

## Assessment Through Portfolio

By the end of this unit, the student will have a portfolio containing:

- **Data Tables**: 2-4 weeks of daily weather observations
- **Graphs**: Multiple types showing weather patterns (bar graphs, line graphs, pictographs)
- **Climate Research**: Profiles of 4-5 climate regions with comparisons
- **Maps**: World climate zones labeled and color-coded
- **Weather Hazard Analysis**: Research on hazards and solution evaluations
- **Arguments and Claims**: Evidence-based reasoning about solutions
- **Photos/Drawings**: Weather documentation, climate examples

This portfolio demonstrates mastery of all 3 Earth and Space Science performance expectations and readiness for 4th grade science.

## Getting Started

1. **Gather common materials** (see Materials Overview above)
2. **Create account** at pbslearningmedia.org (free)
3. **Set up science notebook** with student
4. **Choose your pacing** (sequential, concurrent, or seasonal)
5. **Start with Section 1** - click link above to begin!
6. **Important**: Section 1 requires daily observations, so start this section first even if you plan to work on other sections simultaneously.

## Connection to Climate Science

This unit provides age-appropriate introduction to climate concepts:

- **Weather vs. Climate**: Understanding the difference (short-term vs. long-term)
- **Data Analysis**: Using evidence to identify patterns
- **Regional Variation**: Why different places have different climates
- **Human Responses**: How communities prepare for and adapt to weather challenges

These concepts build foundation for future climate change education in middle and high school.

---

## Local Connections

**Make it Relevant**:
- Use YOUR local weather for Section 1 observations
- Compare YOUR climate to other regions in Section 2
- Research weather hazards common to YOUR area in Section 3
- Visit local weather stations or meteorology centers if available
- Invite local meteorologist to talk with student (virtual or in-person)

---

**Questions or Modifications?**

These investigations are designed to be flexible. Feel free to:
- Adjust session times based on student interest and energy
- Extend observation period if student is engaged
- Focus on weather hazards relevant to your location
- Add extension activities from student questions
- Connect to current weather events and news
- Use real-time weather data sources

The goal is engaging, meaningful science learning that builds understanding of weather, climate, and how humans interact with Earth systems!
