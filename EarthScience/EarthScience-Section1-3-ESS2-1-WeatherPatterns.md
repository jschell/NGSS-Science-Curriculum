---

#### Part 3: Observation Routine (10-15 minutes)

**Set Up Daily Routine**:

**Adult and Student Decide**:
- **What time each day?** (Same time daily is important)

**Adult Explains**:
"Scientists need lots of data to find patterns. Missing days is okay, but try to observe most days. We need at least 14 days of data to see patterns."

---

#### Part 4: First Observations (10 minutes)

**Today's Observation**:

**Student Does**:
1. Check weather source (website, thermometer, or both)
2. Look outside at sky

**Tips for Success**:
- **Make it routine** - Same time, same place
- **Keep it short** - 5-10 minutes maximum
- **No lectures** - Just observe and record
- **Celebrate consistency** - "Great job collecting data!"

**If You Miss a Day**:

## Troubleshooting

**"We missed several days of observations"**:
- That's okay! Continue with remaining days
- Need at least 14 days total for patterns
- Don't try to fill in past data from memory
- Note gaps in data table

**"The weather was the same every day"**:
- This IS a pattern! (stable weather)
- Graph will show flat line or similar bars
- Discussion: "Why might weather be stable?"
- Even small changes are worth noting

**"My student doesn't want to observe daily"**:
- Make it quick (5 minutes)
- Do together initially
- Use phone alarm as reminder
- Connect to something they care about (outdoor play? Sports?)
- Consider shorter observation period (2 weeks minimum)

**"Our graphs don't show clear patterns"**:
- Weather is variable! That's real science
- Patterns can be "mostly variable"
- Discussion: Why is weather hard to predict?
- Focus on what DID happen, not what "should" happen

**"Student wants to observe more factors"**:
- Great! Add columns: humidity, air pressure, sunrise/sunset time
- Connect to weather station data
- More data = more patterns possible
