## HOW TO USE THE MASTER PROMPT

### Step 1: Choose a Section
Decide which section to generate:
- Life Science (most complex, most standards)
- Earth Science (weather observations required)
- Environmental & Sustainability (project-based)

### Step 2: Provide the Prompt
Give the language model:
1. The master prompt document (`PROMPT_Template_for_Remaining_Sections.md`)
2. Access to the GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/jschell/24ece13fa858042d2b16f5ce86a77fad)
3. Access to the completed Physical Science guide as reference
4. Specification of which section to create

### Step 3: Review and Iterate
The model will create:
1. Complete markdown learning guide (2,000-2,500+ lines)
2. Python script to generate PDF templates
3. Executed PDFs (8-15 templates depending on section)

Review the output and request refinements as needed.

### Step 4: Repeat for Remaining Sections
Once satisfied with one section, repeat the process for the other two sections.

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Families Using This Curriculum

**Year-Long Pacing** (recommended):
- Week 1-5: Physical Science (Forces and Motion)
- Week 6-12: Life Science (7 weeks for 8 standards)
- Week 13-16: Earth Science (with ongoing weather observations)
- Ongoing: Environmental & Sustainability projects throughout year

**Intensive Pacing** (accelerated):
- 3-4 sessions per week
- Complete in one semester
- Requires dedicated time blocks

**Integrated Pacing** (flexible):
- Mix sections based on season and interest
- Weather observations in spring/fall
- Life science coordinated with outdoor observations
- Environmental projects tied to community events

### Student Portfolio

By end of year, student will have:
- 50+ completed investigation sheets
- Data tables and graphs
- Drawings and diagrams
- Engineering designs
- Research reports
- Reflection writings
- Photo documentation
- Physical models and creations

This becomes evidence of NGSS mastery and can support:
- Homeschool documentation
- Transfer to traditional school
- Demonstrating grade-level competency
- Building science confidence and skills

## CONTACT & FEEDBACK

This curriculum was developed for home learning with one student and one parent/teacher. It prioritizes:
- Accessibility (household materials)
- Quality (NGSS-aligned, research-based)
- Practicality (realistic time, clear procedures)
- Engagement (hands-on, student-driven)

Feedback on implementation, suggestions for improvement, and reports of what worked well are valuable for future refinements.

**Status**: Physical Science complete. Three sections remaining.
**Next Step**: Use master prompt to generate Life Science guide and templates.
**Timeline**: All sections can be generated in 5-7 hours of AI-assisted work.
**Result**: Complete, professional-quality, home-implementable 3rd grade science curriculum.
