  * At 8:00: "Why don't all dead things become fossils?"
```

### 3. INVESTIGATION DESIGN

**Every Performance Expectation Must Include**:
- At least 2-4 hands-on investigation sessions
- Real data collection with measurements or observations
- Analysis activities (graphing, comparing, concluding)
- Opportunities for student questions and predictions
- Connection to real-world examples

**Investigation Types**:

- Data analysis (graphing weather data, comparing traits)
- Model building (life cycle diagrams, food webs)
- Research projects (climate regions, animal adaptations)
- Engineering design (solutions to environmental problems)

### 4. HOUSEHOLD MATERIALS ONLY

**Do NOT Require**:
- Specialized science equipment
- Expensive materials
- Hard-to-find items
- Live animals (except optional observations of pets/local wildlife)

**DO Use**:

- Outdoor observations (no collecting unless appropriate)

### 5. AGE-APPROPRIATE COMPLEXITY

**For 3rd Grade (8-9 year olds)**:
- Investigations: 30-90 minutes per session
- Reading level: 3rd grade (adult can read aloud as needed)
- Math skills: Basic graphing, simple calculations, counting
- Writing: Sentences and short paragraphs, with templates/scaffolds
- Independence: Can follow 3-5 step procedures with adult nearby

**Avoid**:
- Multi-week projects without clear milestones
- Complex equipment setup
- Extensive writing without templates
- Abstract concepts without concrete examples

### 6. TIME ACCURACY

**Be Realistic About Time**:
- Include setup/cleanup in session times
- Account for student questions and discussion
- Allow time for mistakes and iteration
- Build in flexibility (provide time ranges)

**Session Pacing**:
- Minimum session: 30 minutes (too short = incomplete learning)
- Maximum session: 90 minutes (too long = fatigue)
- Ideal: 45-60 minutes with clear stopping points

### 7. ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION

**Each Section Must End With**:
- Completion checklist (specific deliverables)
- Portfolio contents list
- Time investment summary
- Optional extension activities

**Throughout the Guide**:
- Photo documentation opportunities
- Data tables that stay in notebook
- Reflection prompts
- Parent discussion questions

### 8. THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING

**Every Investigation Must Integrate**:

**Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)**:
- Choose 2-3 practices per investigation
- Make them explicit in the session objectives
- Examples: Asking questions, planning investigations, analyzing data, constructing explanations, arguing from evidence, obtaining/evaluating information

**Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)**:
- This is the content (life cycles, weather, heredity, etc.)
- Build progressively through sessions
- Connect to student prior knowledge

**Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)**:
- Identify which concepts apply (patterns, cause/effect, scale, systems, energy/matter, structure/function, stability/change)
- Point them out explicitly to student
- Use as thinking tools

**Example Integration**:
```markdown
**Three-Dimensional Learning**:
- **SEP**: Analyzing and Interpreting Data (comparing traits across family members)
- **DCI**: LS3.A Inheritance of Traits (traits are inherited from parents)
- **CCC**: Patterns (we can see patterns of similar traits in related organisms)
```

## SPECIFIC GUIDANCE BY SECTION

### For Life Science Guide

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Life Cycles**: Use videos/photos (not live animals unless optional). Compare different organisms. Create models.
2. **Heredity**: Family photos (with permission), pet photos, plant observations. Data tables comparing traits.
3. **Variation**: Observe variation within species (e.g., different dog breeds, different apple varieties). Connect to survival advantages.
4. **Fossils**: Videos, images, replica observations if available. Timeline activities. Discussion of evidence.
5. **Adaptation**: Research activities, case studies, argument construction with evidence.
6. **Environmental Change**: Current events examples, solution design projects.

**Key PBS Resources to Use** (from PBS Resources.md):
- "Growth and Development | PBS LearningMedia" - life cycles
- "Growth, Development, and Reproduction | Nature Collection" - life cycle videos
- PBS resources on inherited traits and environmental effects
- "GPS: Dinosaurs | PBS LearningMedia" - fossils
- "Evolution and Adaptation | Think Wednesday Collection"
- "Resilience and Ecosystem Adaptation"

**Challenges to Address**:
- Evolution is appropriate at 3rd grade as "change over time" and "variation helps survival" - keep it concrete
- Avoid requiring dissection or harming animals
- Use plenty of visual examples (videos, photos, drawings)
- Make heredity concrete with observable traits

### For Earth and Space Sciences Guide

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Weather Patterns**: Daily weather observations over 2-4 weeks. Graphing data. Seasonal patterns.
2. **Climate**: Research different climate regions. Compare local climate to others. Maps and data analysis.
3. **Weather Hazards**: Research local hazards (location dependent). Design solutions. Engineering integration.

**Key PBS Resources to Use**:
- "Weather & Climate Collection | NASA-funded" - comprehensive collection
- "Using Weather Data to Find Patterns | Lesson Plan"
- "What Is Weather? | Interactive Lesson"
- "Observing Weather Factors | Lesson Plan"

**Challenges to Address**:
- Weather observation requires 2-4 weeks of daily data collection (can be 2 minutes per day)
- Climate research requires internet access for data
- Solutions to weather hazards should be age-appropriate and feasible

**Special Considerations**:
- This section naturally involves some waiting time (weather observations)
- Can overlap with other sections - student observes weather while doing life science
- User location affects relevant weather hazards to study
- Use local weather data sources (Weather.gov, local news)

### For Environmental & Sustainability Education Guide

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Environmental Sustainability Analysis**: Research local environmental issues. Multiple perspectives (individual, community, tribal). Real-world connections.
2. **School Grounds Investigation**: If homeschool, use yard/neighborhood. Water quality, air quality, biodiversity, waste observations. Data collection and presentation.
3. **Personal Responsibility**: Action planning, implementation, reflection. Real behavior change project.

**Challenges to Address**:
- This is PROJECT-BASED learning - different structure than other sections
- Involves community engagement (with parent facilitation)
- Requires synthesis of multiple sources
- May involve field work and interviews
- Time can spread across semester

**Special Considerations**:
- Projects can integrate with Life Science or Earth Science topics
- Strong emphasis on local relevance
- Tribal perspectives (in Washington State context) should be authentic
- Action projects should be student-chosen and age-appropriate

**Project Examples**:
- Backyard habitat improvement
- Waste reduction at home
- Water conservation project
- Neighborhood litter cleanup with data collection
- School/home energy use study
