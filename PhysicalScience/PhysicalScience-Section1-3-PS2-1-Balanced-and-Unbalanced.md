## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: What Are Forces? (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that forces are pushes and pulls that cause objects to move or stop.

#### Part 1: Free Exploration (20 minutes)

**Student Does**:
1. Take toy car and ball
2. Find 5 different ways to make each object move
3. For each method, write in notebook: What did you do?

**Adult Does**:
- Observe without directing
- Ask open-ended questions:
  * "What made it move?"
  * "Did you push or pull?"
  * "What happened when you pushed harder?"
- Take photos/videos of student discoveries

**Expected Discoveries**:
- Pushing makes things move
- Pulling makes things move
- Harder pushes = faster/farther motion
- Gentle pushes = slower/shorter motion

#### Part 2: Guided Investigation - Identifying Forces (20 minutes)

**Adult Guides With Questions**:
1. "Show me a push force" → Student demonstrates
2. "Show me a pull force" → Student demonstrates
3. "What's happening to the object when you push/pull?" → Discuss motion

**Activity**:
- Together, walk around house
- Identify 10 forces in action:
  * Opening door (pull)
  * Closing door (push)
  * Sitting (push from chair)
  * Picking up object (pull from hand)
- Student records in notebook with simple drawings

**Key Vocabulary to Introduce**:
- **Force**: A push or a pull
- **Motion**: When something changes position

#### Part 3: Video Learning (15 minutes)

**Watch Together**:
- **Video**: Selected clips from "Force and Motion | Science Trek" 
- **Link**: https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/idptv11.sci.phys.maf.d4kfom/science-trek/
- **Segments to Watch**: 
  * 0:00-5:00 (Introduction to forces)
  * 10:30-15:00 (Examples of forces in action)

**Pause Points for Discussion**:
- When video shows push/pull: "Can you find something in our house that works the same way?"
- When showing motion: "Why did that object move?"

#### Part 4: Demonstration and Recording (20 minutes)

**Structured Demonstrations** - Student performs, adult records:

1. **Gentle Push**: 
   - Push car gently across floor
   - Measure how far it goes
   - Record distance

2. **Medium Push**:
   - Push same car with medium force
   - Measure distance
   - Record

3. **Hard Push**:
   - Push same car hard
   - Measure distance
   - Record

**Data Recording**:
```
Push Strength | Distance Traveled | Drawing
Gentle        | ___ cm/inches     | [sketch]
Medium        | ___ cm/inches     | [sketch]
Hard          | ___ cm/inches     | [sketch]
```

**Discussion Questions** (Adult asks):
- "What pattern do you see in your data?"
- "Why did the car go farther with a harder push?"
- "Is this what you predicted would happen?"

---

### Session 2: Balanced Forces (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that balanced forces cause no change in motion.

#### Part 1: Introduction Activity (10 minutes)

**Setup**:
- Find sturdy book (hardcover)
- Place on smooth table

**Adult and Student Together**:
1. Both push book from opposite sides with equal gentle force
2. Observe: Book doesn't move
3. Adult pushes harder while student keeps same force
4. Observe: Book moves toward student
5. Both stop pushing
6. Observe: Book stays still

**Adult Asks**:
- "When did the book move? When did it stay still?"
- "What was different between the two situations?"

**Introduce Term**: 
- **Balanced Forces** = Equal forces in opposite directions (no motion change)

#### Part 2: Tug-of-War Simulation (15 minutes)

**Materials**: 
- Stuffed animal or toy
- Table edge

**Investigation**:

**Test 1 - Balanced**:
- Student pulls toy toward them gently
- Adult pulls toy toward them with equal gentle force
- Observe: Toy doesn't move (balanced forces)
- Student draws diagram with arrows showing forces

**Test 2 - Unbalanced**:
- Student pulls with same gentle force
- Adult pulls harder
- Observe: Toy moves toward adult (unbalanced forces)
- Student draws diagram with arrows (make adult's arrow longer)

**Test 3 - No Forces**:
- Both let go
- Observe: Toy sits still
- Discuss: Gravity pulls down, table pushes up (balanced)

**Student Records**:
```
Situation          | Balanced or Unbalanced? | What Happened?
Both pull equal    |                         |
Adult pulls harder |                         |
No one pulling     |                         |
```

#### Part 3: Finding Balanced Forces (25 minutes)

**Challenge**: Find 5 examples of balanced forces

**Student Explores House**:
1. Objects sitting still on surfaces (gravity down, surface up)
2. Books on shelf (gravity down, shelf up)
3. Picture on wall (gravity down, hook/wall up)
4. Student sitting in chair (gravity down, chair up)
5. Object in hand (gravity down, hand up)

**For Each Example**:
- Student draws simple diagram
- Labels the two forces with arrows
- Adult asks: "Why isn't it moving?"

#### Part 4: Ramp Investigation (20-25 minutes)

**Setup**:
- Create ramp using book and ruler/board
- Place toy car at top

**Investigation Questions**:

**Question 1**: "What forces act on the car at rest on the ramp?"
- Gravity pulling down
- Ramp pushing back up
- Student's hand holding it (if applicable)
- Are they balanced? (Yes, if car isn't moving)

**Question 2**: "What happens when we let go?"
- Remove hand
- Observe: Car rolls down
- Why? Forces become unbalanced (gravity wins)

**Question 3**: "Can we balance the car again?"
- Try: Pushing gently up ramp while gravity pulls down
- Find exact push to keep car still
- This is balancing forces!

**Student Creates**:
- Before/After diagrams showing balanced vs. unbalanced forces on ramp

Medium        |              |              |              |
Hard          |              |              |              |
```

**Adult Helps**:
- Keep push strength consistent within each set
- Help with measuring if needed
- Ensure data is recorded accurately

#### Part 3: Analysis and Graphing (30 minutes)

**Calculate Averages** (10 minutes):

- Title: "How Push Strength Affects Distance"
- Color code bars

**Discussion Questions** (5 minutes):

Adult asks, student responds (record answers):
1. "What pattern do you see in your graph?"
   - Expected: Harder pushes = farther distance
2. "Why do you think this happened?"
   - Expected: Bigger force creates more motion
3. "If you pushed even harder, what would happen?"
   - Expected: Car would go even farther
4. "What force made the car stop rolling?"
   - Expected: Friction from floor

#### Part 4: Extension - Ramp Experiment (15 minutes)

**Quick Investigation**:

**Setup**:
- Create 3 ramps using books:
  * Ramp 1: 1 book under ruler
  * Ramp 2: 2 books under ruler  
  * Ramp 3: 3 books under ruler

**Test**:
- Release car from top of each ramp
- Measure distance it rolls after leaving ramp
- Record which ramp made car go farthest

**Discussion**:
- "Steeper ramp = more force from gravity"
- "More force = more distance traveled"
- Connect back to main investigation

**End of Session Documentation**:
- Take photos of data table and graph
- Student writes: "Today I learned that stronger forces cause objects to move farther because..."
