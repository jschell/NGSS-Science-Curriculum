## INVESTIGATION SESSIONS

### Session 1: Measuring and Graphing Motion (90 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that regular motion creates predictable patterns that can be graphed.

#### Part 1: Introduction - Mystery Motion (10 minutes)

**Activity**:
- Adult walks across room at steady, slow pace
- Student closes eyes
- Adult asks: "If I keep walking like this, where will I be in 5 more seconds?"
- Student predicts by pointing
- Adult continues walking, check prediction

**Discussion**:
- "How did you make your guess?"
- "I was moving in a pattern - steady speed"
- "Today we'll use patterns to predict motion"

#### Part 2: Recording Position Over Time (30 minutes)

**Investigation**: Track where a rolling car is at each second

**Setup**:
- Create ramp with book + ruler
- Position at top of measurement track
- Student gets stopwatch ready

**Procedure** (do 3 complete trials):

**Roles**:
- Adult: Releases car at "Go", calls time every second ("1... 2... 3... 4... 5...")
- Student: Marks where car is when each number is called OR records distance on pre-marked track

**How to Mark Position**:
Method A: Put small piece of tape where car is at each second
Method B: Record which distance line (20cm, 40cm, etc.) car is closest to

**Data Recording** (Example):
```
Trial 1:
Time (sec) | Distance from Start (cm)
0          | 0
1          | 15
2          | 35
3          | 52
4          | 68
5          | 85
```

**Repeat for Trials 2 and 3**

**Adult's Role**:
- Keep time calls consistent
- Help student stay focused on car position
- Assist with measurements if needed

#### Part 3: Creating Motion Graph (25 minutes)

**Student Task**: Turn data into visual graph

**Step-by-Step** (adult guides):

1. **Set Up Graph** (5 min):
   - Label X-axis: Time (seconds)
   - Label Y-axis: Distance from start (cm)
   - Title: "Car Rolling Down Ramp"

2. **Plot Points** (10 min):
   - For each time/distance pair, make a dot
   - Example: At time = 1 sec, distance = 15 cm, put dot at that intersection
   - Plot all points from Trial 1

3. **Connect Points** (5 min):
   - Draw line connecting all dots
   - What shape is the line?

4. **Add Trials 2 and 3** (5 min) - Optional:
   - Use different colors
   - Plot on same graph
   - Compare: Are lines similar?

**Discussion Questions**:

Adult asks:
- "Describe the shape of your line"
  - Expected: Straight, diagonal, going up
- "What does this line tell us?"
  - Expected: Car keeps moving, gaining distance each second
- "Is the car moving at the same speed the whole time?"
  - Look at line: Straight = yes, steady speed

#### Part 4: Using Patterns to Predict (25 minutes)

**Challenge**: Use your graph to predict the future!

**Question**: "Based on your pattern, where will the car be at 6 seconds? 7 seconds?"

**Student Does**:
1. Extend graph lines (use dotted line)
2. Read predicted positions from extended line
3. Write predictions:
   - At 6 seconds: _____ cm
   - At 7 seconds: _____ cm

**Test Predictions**:
- Run investigation again
- Time 6 and 7 seconds
- Measure actual positions
- Compare to predictions

**Calculate Accuracy**:
```
Predicted at 6 sec: ___ cm
Actual at 6 sec: ___ cm
Difference: ___ cm
Was I close? ___
```

**Discussion**:
- "How close was your prediction?"
- "Why was the graph useful?"
- "Would this work if the car was speeding up or slowing down?"

### Session 2: Different Motion Patterns (60-90 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that different types of motion create different graph patterns.

#### Part 1: Pendulum Investigation (30 minutes)

**Setup**:
- Tie weight to 50cm string
- Hang from doorway or have adult hold
- Create simple pendulum

**Investigation**: Do pendulums swing in predictable patterns?

**Question**: "How many times will it swing in 30 seconds?"

**Procedure**:

**Trial 1**:
1. Pull weight to side, release
2. Count complete swings in 30 seconds
3. Record: ____ swings

**Trial 2**:
1. Same setup, repeat
2. Count swings
3. Record

**Trial 3**:
1. Same setup, repeat
2. Count swings
3. Record

**Data**:
```
Trial | Number of Swings in 30 sec
1     |
2     |
3     |
Average: ____
```

**Prediction**:
- Based on pattern, predict swings in 60 seconds: ____
- Test by counting for full 60 seconds
- Actual swings: ____
- How accurate? ____

**Discussion**:
- "Did the pendulum swing the same number of times each 30 seconds?"
- "Yes! This is a repeating pattern"
- "Repeating patterns are very predictable"

#### Part 2: Comparing Motion Patterns (30 minutes)

**Activity**: Create graphs of different motions

**Motion 1 - Steady Walking**:
- Mark 5 spots on floor (20 cm apart)
- Student walks steadily, adult calls: "Stop!" at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds
- Record position at each time
- Graph it - should be straight line

**Motion 2 - Getting Faster**:
- Student starts walking slowly, gradually speeds up
- Adult calls times, student notes positions
- Graph it - should curve upward more steeply
- Pattern: Distance increasing MORE each second

**Motion 3 - Getting Slower**:
- Student starts fast, gradually slows down
- Record and graph
- Pattern: Distance increasing LESS each second

**Student Draws All Three Graphs** (can be on same axes with different colors)

**Analysis**:
Adult and student compare:
- "How are the graphs different?"
- "What does a straight line mean?" (Steady speed)
- "What does a curving line mean?" (Speed changing)

#### Part 3: Prediction Challenge (15-30 minutes) - Optional Extension

**Setup Challenges**:

**Challenge 1: Ball Roll**:
- Roll ball down ramp
- Measure position at 1, 2, 3 seconds
- Create quick mini-graph
- Predict: Where at 4 seconds?
- Test and verify

**Challenge 2: Wind-Up Toy** (if available):
- Wind toy same amount each time
- Measure how far it goes (3 trials)
- Find average
- Predict: How far on trial 4?
- Test
- Calculate accuracy: How close?

**Challenge 3: Bouncing Ball**:
- Drop ball from same height 5 times
- Measure first bounce height each time
- Find average
- Predict 6th bounce
- Test

**Scoring**:
- Within 5 cm: Excellent prediction!
- Within 10 cm: Good prediction
- Within 20 cm: Okay prediction
- Discuss: What made predicting easy or hard?
