## Parent Tips for Success

**Create Supportive Learning Environment**:
- Let student lead investigations
- Ask questions rather than give answers
- Celebrate effort and learning, not just "right" answers
- Allow productive struggle - don't solve problems for them

**Guide Questions to Ask**:
- "What do you notice?"
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How could you test that idea?"
- "What does your data show?"

**When Student Gets Frustrated**:
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What's one small thing you could change?"
- "Want to take a break and come back?"
- "Scientists and engineers face challenges - this is normal!"

**Document Learning**:
- Take photos of investigations and creations
- Save all notebook pages and data
- Create portfolio to show progress
- Share with family members

**Make It Fun**:
- Follow student interests for extensions
- Connect to real-world examples they care about
- Celebrate discoveries with enthusiasm
- Remember: The process matters more than perfect results
