#### Part 1: Free Exploration (20 minutes)

**Student Does**:
1. Take toy car and ball
2. Find 5 different ways to make each object move
3. For each method, write in notebook: What did you do?

**Adult Does**:

- Ask open-ended questions:
  * "What made it move?"
  * "Did you push or pull?"
  * "What happened when you pushed harder?"
- Take photos/videos of student discoveries

**Expected Discoveries**:
- Pushing makes things move
- Pulling makes things move
- Harder pushes = faster/farther motion
- Gentle pushes = slower/shorter motion

#### Part 2: Guided Investigation - Identifying Forces (20 minutes)

**Adult Guides With Questions**:
1. "Show me a push force" → Student demonstrates
2. "Show me a pull force" → Student demonstrates
3. "What's happening to the object when you push/pull?" → Discuss motion

**Activity**:

- "Why did the car go farther with a harder push?"
- "Is this what you predicted would happen?"

---

### Session 2: Balanced Forces (60-75 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover that balanced forces cause no change in motion.

#### Part 1: Introduction Activity (10 minutes)

**Setup**:
- Find sturdy book (hardcover)
- Place on smooth table

**Adult and Student Together**:
1. Both push book from opposite sides with equal gentle force
2. Observe: Book doesn't move
3. Adult pushes harder while student keeps same force
4. Observe: Book moves toward student
5. Both stop pushing
6. Observe: Book stays still

**Adult Asks**:
- "When did the book move? When did it stay still?"
- "What was different between the two situations?"

**Introduce Term**: 
- **Balanced Forces** = Equal forces in opposite directions (no motion change)

#### Part 2: Tug-of-War Simulation (15 minutes)

**Materials**: 
- Stuffed animal or toy
- Table edge

**Investigation**:

**Test 1 - Balanced**:
- Student pulls toy toward them gently
- Adult pulls toy toward them with equal gentle force
- Observe: Toy doesn't move (balanced forces)
- Student draws diagram with arrows showing forces

**Test 2 - Unbalanced**:
- Student pulls with same gentle force
- Adult pulls harder
- Observe: Toy moves toward adult (unbalanced forces)
- Student draws diagram with arrows (make adult's arrow longer)

**Test 3 - No Forces**:
- Both let go
- Observe: Toy sits still
- Discuss: Gravity pulls down, table pushes up (balanced)

**Student Records**:
```
Situation          | Balanced or Unbalanced? | What Happened?
Both pull equal    |                         |
Adult pulls harder |                         |
No one pulling     |                         |
```

#### Part 3: Finding Balanced Forces (25 minutes)

**Challenge**: Find 5 examples of balanced forces

**Student Explores House**:

2. Books on shelf (gravity down, shelf up)
3. Picture on wall (gravity down, hook/wall up)
4. Student sitting in chair (gravity down, chair up)
5. Object in hand (gravity down, hand up)

**For Each Example**:
- Student draws simple diagram

**Investigation Questions**:

**Question 1**: "What forces act on the car at rest on the ramp?"
- Gravity pulling down
- Ramp pushing back up
- Student's hand holding it (if applicable)
- Are they balanced? (Yes, if car isn't moving)

**Question 2**: "What happens when we let go?"
- Remove hand
- Observe: Car rolls down
- Why? Forces become unbalanced (gravity wins)

**Question 3**: "Can we balance the car again?"
- Try: Pushing gently up ramp while gravity pulls down
- Find exact push to keep car still
- This is balancing forces!

**Student Creates**:

**Hands-On Testing** (17 minutes):

**Test 1 - Finding Poles**:
1. Take two bar magnets
2. Hold one steady on table
3. Bring second magnet close
4. Try different orientations (flip magnet around)
5. Observe: Sometimes they pull together, sometimes push apart

**Observations**:
```
Magnet Ends Facing | What Happened? (attract/repel)
N to N             |
N to S             |
S to N             |
S to S             |
```

**Pattern Discovery**:
- "What pattern do you see?"
- Expected finding:
  * N to N = REPEL (push apart)
  * S to S = REPEL (push apart)
  * N to S = ATTRACT (pull together)
  * S to N = ATTRACT (pull together)

**Rule**: Opposite poles attract, same poles repel

**Test 2 - Feeling the Force**:
- Hold magnets with same poles facing
- Push gently together
- Feel them push back
- "You can FEEL the force even though magnets aren't touching!"

**Vocabulary** (write in notebook with examples):
- **Attract**: Pull together
- **Repel**: Push apart  
- **Poles**: The two ends of a magnet (N and S)

**Data Table**:
```
Material       | Did Magnet Work? (Yes/No) | Notes
1 sheet paper  |                           |
5 sheets paper |                           |
10 sheets paper|                           |

Aluminum foil  |                           |
```

**Findings**:
- "Magnetic force works through non-magnetic materials"
- "But it gets weaker as distance increases"
- "Eventually, too far = doesn't work"

#### Part 2: Measuring Magnetic Strength (30 minutes)

**Investigation**: Which magnet is strongest?

**Method**: Paper clip chain test

**Procedure** (for each magnet you have):
1. Touch magnet to one paper clip
2. Touch second clip to first clip
3. Keep adding clips to make chain
4. When chain breaks, count how many clips were connected
5. Record number
6. Repeat 2 more times
7. Calculate average

**Data**:
```
Magnet Type      | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 | Average
Bar magnet #1    |         |         |         |
Bar magnet #2    |         |         |         |
Fridge magnet    |         |         |         |
Horseshoe magnet |         |         |         |
```

**Analysis**:
- Create bar graph showing average clips for each magnet
- Rank magnets from strongest to weakest
- Discussion: "Why might some magnets be stronger?"

**Extension - Distance Test**:
- Place paper clip on table
- Slowly bring magnet closer from above
- Measure: How far away when clip first moves?
- Stronger magnets = work from farther away

2. Try to bring them close together
3. Feel them push apart - they repel!

**Observations**:
```
Test              | What Happened?
Balloon + paper   |
Comb + hair       |
Two balloons      |
```

#### Part 2: Compare Electric and Magnetic Forces (15 minutes)

**Create Venn Diagram**:

**Magnetic Forces** (left circle):
- Only work on iron/steel
- Always work (don't wear off)
- Need special magnet object

**Both** (middle overlap):
- Work without touching
- Can attract AND repel
- Get weaker with distance
- Invisible forces

**Electric Forces** (right circle):

**Explain** (10 minutes):

1. **Design Presentations** (7 minutes):
   - 3-4 teams share plans (1-2 minutes each)
   - Class asks clarifying questions
   - Feedback: Will it meet criteria? Any concerns?

2. **Refine Plans** (3 minutes):
   - Based on feedback, make quick adjustments
   - Teacher checks plans before building phase

**Evaluate** (5 minutes):

1. **Plan Check**:
   - Students self-assess using checklist:
     * [ ] Clear diagram with labels
