#### Part 1: Mystery Force Demo (10 minutes)

**Demonstration**:
1. Adult places paper clip on table
2. Adult holds magnet UNDER table
3. Adult moves magnet - paper clip moves without being touched!
4. Student tries it

**Discussion**:
- "How is this possible?"
- "The magnet works through the table"
- "The magnet pulls the paper clip even without touching it"

**Student Questions**:
- Record 3-5 questions about magnets in notebook
- Examples: "What can magnets stick to?", "How far away does it work?", "Can magnets push things?"

#### Part 2: Testing Magnetic vs. Non-Magnetic (25 minutes)

**Investigation**: Which items are attracted to magnets?

**Prediction First**:
- Student looks at all sorted items
- Reviews predictions (which bins items are in)
- Records predictions in table

**Testing**:
- Student tests each item with magnet
- Does it stick? Yes or No
- Record results

**Data Table**:
```
Item           | Prediction (Yes/No) | Actual Result (Yes/No) | Magnetic?
Paper clip     |                     |                        |
Penny          |                     |                        |
Nail           |                     |                        |
Plastic toy    |                     |                        |
Aluminum foil  |                     |                        |
Scissors       |                     |                        |
Rubber band    |                     |                        |
[add more...]  |                     |                        |
```

**Analysis Questions**:

Adult asks:
- "What do the magnetic items have in common?"
  - Expected: They're metal (specifically iron/steel)
- "Were any of your predictions wrong? Which ones?"
- "Why do you think aluminum foil didn't stick?"
  - Different type of metal

**Create Categories**:
- Magnetic: Iron, steel, nickel, cobalt
- Not Magnetic: Plastic, wood, paper, most metals (aluminum, copper, brass)

#### Part 3: Magnet Poles - Attraction and Repulsion (25 minutes)

**Investigation**: How do two magnets interact?

**Watch First** (8 minutes):
- **Video**: "Magnets!" from PBS
- **Link**: https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/reach-with-stem-magnets/magnets/
- **Focus on**: The section showing magnetic poles attracting and repelling (around 2:00-4:00)

**Hands-On Testing** (17 minutes):

**Test 1 - Finding Poles**:
1. Take two bar magnets
2. Hold one steady on table
3. Bring second magnet close
4. Try different orientations (flip magnet around)
5. Observe: Sometimes they pull together, sometimes push apart

**Observations**:
```
Magnet Ends Facing | What Happened? (attract/repel)
N to N             |
N to S             |
S to N             |
S to S             |
```

**Pattern Discovery**:
- "What pattern do you see?"
- Expected finding:
  * N to N = REPEL (push apart)
  * S to S = REPEL (push apart)
  * N to S = ATTRACT (pull together)
  * S to N = ATTRACT (pull together)

**Rule**: Opposite poles attract, same poles repel

**Test 2 - Feeling the Force**:
- Hold magnets with same poles facing
- Push gently together
- Feel them push back
- "You can FEEL the force even though magnets aren't touching!"

**Vocabulary** (write in notebook with examples):
- **Attract**: Pull together
- **Repel**: Push apart  
- **Poles**: The two ends of a magnet (N and S)
- **Magnetic Force**: Works without touching

#### Part 4: Documentation (10-15 minutes)

**Student Creates**:

1. **Diagram of Magnetic Attraction**:
   - Draw two magnets with opposite poles facing
   - Add arrows showing force direction
   - Label: "Attract - opposite poles pull together"

2. **Diagram of Magnetic Repulsion**:
   - Draw two magnets with same poles facing  
   - Add arrows showing force pushing apart
   - Label: "Repel - same poles push apart"

3. **List**:
   - 5 magnetic items found
   - 5 non-magnetic items found
   - Pattern statement: "Magnets attract items made of..."

### Session 2: Magnetic Force at a Distance (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Investigate how magnetic force works through materials and over distance.

#### Part 1: Force Through Materials (30 minutes)

**Investigation Question**: Can magnetic force work through things?

**Setup**:
- Paper clip on table
- Magnet
- Various materials: paper, cardboard, plastic folder, wooden board, aluminum foil

**Test 1 - Through Paper**:
- Place 1 sheet of paper on table
- Put paper clip on top of paper
- Hold magnet under paper
- Move magnet - does clip move?
- Record: YES or NO

**Continue Testing**:
- Add papers one at a time
- Test: How many sheets before magnetism doesn't work?
- Record maximum number

**Test 2 - Different Materials**:
- Test with: cardboard, plastic, wood, aluminum foil
- For each, record: Does magnetic force work through it?

**Data Table**:
```
Material       | Did Magnet Work? (Yes/No) | Notes
1 sheet paper  |                           |
5 sheets paper |                           |
10 sheets paper|                           |
Cardboard      |                           |
Plastic folder |                           |
Wood block     |                           |
Aluminum foil  |                           |
```

**Findings**:
- "Magnetic force works through non-magnetic materials"
- "But it gets weaker as distance increases"
- "Eventually, too far = doesn't work"

#### Part 2: Measuring Magnetic Strength (30 minutes)

**Investigation**: Which magnet is strongest?

**Method**: Paper clip chain test

**Procedure** (for each magnet you have):
1. Touch magnet to one paper clip
2. Touch second clip to first clip
3. Keep adding clips to make chain
4. When chain breaks, count how many clips were connected
5. Record number
6. Repeat 2 more times
7. Calculate average

**Data**:
```
Magnet Type      | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 | Average
Bar magnet #1    |         |         |         |
Bar magnet #2    |         |         |         |
Fridge magnet    |         |         |         |
Horseshoe magnet |         |         |         |
```

**Analysis**:
- Create bar graph showing average clips for each magnet
- Rank magnets from strongest to weakest
- Discussion: "Why might some magnets be stronger?"

**Extension - Distance Test**:
- Place paper clip on table
- Slowly bring magnet closer from above
- Measure: How far away when clip first moves?
- Stronger magnets = work from farther away

### Session 3: Static Electricity (45-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Discover electric forces and compare to magnetic forces.

**Note**: This is a simplified introduction to electricity, appropriate for 3rd grade.

#### Part 1: Static Electricity Demonstrations (20 minutes)

**Demo 1 - Balloon and Paper**:

**Procedure**:
1. Tear tissue paper into tiny pieces (confetti-size)
2. Rub balloon on wool cloth or hair (15-20 times in same direction)
3. Bring balloon close to paper pieces
4. Observe: They jump to balloon!

**Discussion**:
- "Is this magnetism?" (No - paper isn't metal)
- "This is ELECTRIC force"
- "Electric charge builds up on balloon from rubbing"

**Demo 2 - Plastic Comb**:
1. Rub plastic comb on hair/wool
2. Hold near small paper scraps
3. Observe attraction
4. Try near: puffed rice, hair (hold near but don't touch)

**Demo 3 - Repulsion**:
1. Rub two balloons on hair/wool
2. Try to bring them close together
3. Feel them push apart - they repel!

**Observations**:
```
Test              | What Happened?
Balloon + paper   |
Comb + hair       |
Two balloons      |
```

#### Part 2: Compare Electric and Magnetic Forces (15 minutes)

**Create Venn Diagram**:

**Magnetic Forces** (left circle):
- Only work on iron/steel
- Always work (don't wear off)
- Need special magnet object

**Both** (middle overlap):
- Work without touching
- Can attract AND repel
- Get weaker with distance
- Invisible forces

**Electric Forces** (right circle):
- Work on many materials (paper, hair, etc.)
- Temporary (wears off in minutes)
- Can create by rubbing

**Adult Asks**:
- "How are these forces similar?"
- "How are they different?"
- "Which force would be better for picking up paper clips? Why?"

#### Part 3: Investigation Design (20-25 minutes)

**Student Challenge**: Design your own test!

**Choose One Question to Investigate**:
1. "Does rubbing longer make static electricity stronger?"
2. "Which materials create the best static electricity?"
3. "How long does static electricity last?"
4. "Can static electricity work through materials like magnetism can?"

**For Chosen Question**:

**Plan**:
- Write question
- Predict answer
- List materials needed
- Write step-by-step procedure
- Identify: What will you change? What will you measure?

**Conduct**:
- Follow your procedure
- Collect data
- Record observations

**Results**:
- What did you find out?
- Was your prediction correct?
- Draw diagram or create data table

**Adult's Role**:
- Help refine testable question
- Ensure procedure is safe and feasible
- Guide data collection
- Don't give answers - let student discover
