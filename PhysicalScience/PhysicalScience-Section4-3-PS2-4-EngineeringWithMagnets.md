#### Part 4: Final Testing (15-20 minutes)

**Official Test**:

Test improved design against all criteria:

- Record results (measurements, observations)
- Compare to original test results

**Data Comparison**:
```
Criterion        | Original Result | Improved Result | Better?
Remove 5 washers | Retrieved 3     | Retrieved 7     | YES! +4
[etc...]         |                 |                 |
